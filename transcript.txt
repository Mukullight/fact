Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day what killed RK what his his Zionism you know if he didn't have that he I think he could be president but it's you mean RFK Jr yeah oh I I was confused I me I meant figuratively I was like how do this have anything to do with the boycott of Starbucks and McDonald's and Siran San like what some rabbit hole [ __ ] I didn't know about is that possible you know Siran Siran uh his house was in Pasadena which was close to where I used to live really yeah I didn't one day my wife was like yeah the s s lives over here I'm like get out of here I didn't know have you ever read into the MK Ultra connection between Siran Siran Jack Ruby and jolly West so no I haven't but I now I'm working with Kurt mezer and he knows all that [ __ ] he knows he knows too much he know I'm like he just go off you ruined him you've ruined him cuz he didn't I don't think he's aware of so many legitimate actual conspiracies meaning like where governments and corporations conspire against the American people lie twist facts distort things but Kurt is one of those guys that once he finds out something that you know because he had grew up in a cult right so he's in a Jehovah's Witness cult when he was young yeah sorry Jehovah's Witnesses but and then becomes a comedian and you know like he so averse to [ __ ] he's like oh no no no no no cuz like you [ __ ] ruined my childhood I know what this is I've seen this before I've seen this in another form I know what this is yeah that's that's his like superpower because he's been through it you ruined him his show you ruined him he's so he's so crazy now he's so mad now did you see him get upset on the show he he gets legit angry here it is other controversial cases West was assigned to including evaluating Siran San who assassinated Robert F Kennedy uh Jun excuse me at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles June 5th 1968 Wes claims sir ham was a subject of psychic driving a mind altering technique involving hypnosis or paralytic drugs psychiatrists often use barbituate for this sh settle the [ __ ] down you used acid stop lying what is this oh maybe possibly barbituates or something legal now they were using acid who's this West guy Jolly West was the head of MK Ultra he was the guy that they yeah that they Chronicle extensively in Thomas O'Neal's book chaos about the Manson case oh so yeah my wife is reading that right now God damn that's a good book and she hasn't an audio book so I'll walk in the house and I'll hear like what the [ __ ] you know how crazy that book is Tom was uh Greg Fitz Simmons's roommate in New York and then also uh not roommate excuse me neighbor he was his neighbor in New York and then also his neighbor in Venice California like he moved like so they were like near each other for 20 years this guy's been working on this he started working on it as an article right so he writes it as an article but then once he starts getting into the information it's so extensive it's so crazy that he can't finish the article because the article is just an anniversary of the Manson assassinations the Manson killings so then 20 years later he finally puts out this book and he's got enough information for another [ __ ] book and it's wild it's all a CIA plot the Manson family was all Manson was visited in prison by Jolly West they trained him allegedly in hypnosis techniques using LSD how to mind control people he would not do the acid but he would give the acid to the people which is something also that apparently the MK Ultra people trained him and he would get them to commit evil acts and the whole thing was to discredit the anti-war movement that's the whole thing was the hippies yeah yeah so they turn hippie tery hippies used to be like oh she's a flower oh peace and love you know cute nice stuff but then they turned hippies into [ __ ] psychotic murderers who cut babies out of movie stars bellies and paint on the wall Pig you like that kind of [ __ ] uh yeah Kurt yeah Kurt was also telling me about that like that's the perfect way to discredit the anti-war movement yes well that's also why the psychedelics acts of 1970 was passed oh really yes the Psychedelic Act of 1970 was passed to go after the Black Panthers and to go after the civil rights leaders and to go after the anti-war movement because those people were all taking drugs so they're eating mushrooms and trying to come to like some sort of an understanding of our place in the universe and they said okay we're going to take all of these psychedelic compounds that are literally creating a cultural revolution so you you go from the 1950s you you get I always always say music is like the best represent of that and comedy as well but really music if you look at like Buddy Holly great music great stuff and then you Jimmy Hendrick is 10 years later what the [ __ ] is that what is that's like a revolution like out of nowhere something is insanely different like it's not even from this Earth not even from this Earth that's all psychedelics and we've never had a leap like that sense nope isn't that weird like you listen to music from the'80s and a lot of it sounds like it could be made today it's Coke music the ' 80s they were all doing coke they were watching Miami Vice they were doing coke wearing no socks with loafers but remember uh I mean whenever I hear a Prince song I'm like oh that could be made today that could have been from right now yeah well Prince was the most versatile right cuz he could do anything like if you go to his early stuff it was like this real sweet music about [ __ ] you know yes it was all head you ever heard that song head like from his first Al or think is his second album God he was good he was so good I love that he had that there was that band um of Mor day in the time yes I like them almost more than Prince I just like them oh he's got this one song that's on our I think it's on the playlist I hope it's on the playlist it's called if it's not I'm gonna put it on there right now it's called cool cuz I'm cool am I done in San Francisco dance all night in Rome that's it yeah yeah mors day was the [ __ ] yeah Maurice bring me by I love that I could I I thought that Morris day was going to be bigger than I know well I didn't think he's ever going to be bigger than Prince I think Prince is a legitimate was excuse me a legitimate genius oh yeah he was and he's another guy that we lost because of [ __ ] [ __ ] because of fenel yeah you think that's what you okay that's what happened to him what do what do you think about so now people are revisiting the M it wasn't in the playlist it is now oh it is I had to put it in the mother [ __ ] playlist like how's that not a song called walk everybody walk your body everybody walk your body I'm about to walk a hole in my Stacy's he was just so cool and so then I would go out and buy Stacy Adam shoes I I would and so we would there was this place um oh there was a very derogatory it was Maxwell Street in Chicago and they used to call it um I can't say it but um cuz it's anti-semitic and uh so we we would go down there and you could go walk and all these clothes stores and you can bargain with them and I never experienced that before like you walk in and usually the price was the price you go to the mall the price say you can't bargain but you could bargain so it was it was like an exciting thing to do me and my brothers would all go down there and you'd go into all these stores and you'd like put all these clothes together like and we'd start bartering like okay how about this how about that it was fun I miss those days that that's that's where um in in The Blues Brothers remember they go down to get the the black guy who's the clarinet player and um uh you better think think think but so that what whatever that that's where that took place oh wow and um but I think that's all gone now I think they got rid of that uh and they they I don't know what they put it's probably an apple bees I think the the University of Illinois Chicago maybe expanded and to there and took it over oh interesting those were those were the days I missed on Mor stay in the time I missed those days these are the best days but those but then there these days right now these are the best days you think yeah by far by far well they are for me by far for everybody because we get all the other stuff from those other eras we still can listen to that too we can still watch that too but we we have a bizarre time where the world is waking up where people are so much more aware of the corruption and the the just the way the world works is more it's more highlighted than it's ever been before for and I think it's more fun it's it's like some of the things that are stupid are so stupid like when you see Biden we Medicare they go thank you Mr President and they smash cut like how the [ __ ] is that real how is that real the guy like locks up like Windows 95 stammers for 15 seconds and then he says we we beat Medicare I was doing a show the other night at the hotel Cafe in Hollywood and um I do a joke about Joe Biden you know like uh why don't they get dogs that lead them off stage you know and uh and the people in the crowd like they're all like 20-some Hollywood people and they're like and they go oh and I I could I was like what I I have friends like you I know what that it's listen they've done a good good job they've done a really good job of pretending that they're comp Biden I love I've always loved Joe no one's ever [ __ ] loved Joe Biden he's always been a a joke and a punchline and this idea that somehow it's Joe Biden's integrity and Truth telling against Donald Trump he lied lied the first time Joe Biden ran for president he had to drop out because he got exposed for being a pathological liar he said he graduated at the top of his class he graduated at the bottom he said he had three Majors he know what he said he was chosen the most outstanding political no it was all lies and then he got caught plagiarizing someone else not only this their speeches but like their life story he like it was like who does that and so he had to they he's been a joke always was a joke and this idea you know uh the reason why black and brown I had to I had to you know uh tell this to Cornell West when he came on my show hey the reason why black and brown people are locked up at way higher rates than their population is because of Joe Biden not because of Donald Trump Donald Trump actually did the step back right which is probably why he's getting 20% of the black vote right now this so this all the um all all their you're right all their narratives are are Falling Away people are waking up and not only in America but I I do not to get I do miss a time before cell phones and the internet it was it was like more of an innocent time I do miss that time I'm glad we went through it yeah I mean I'm I'm also I don't miss it okay but um but um I I was just in Europe right I want a a 11 Day Tour or whatever and um I didn't know if I was going to have you know anybody's going to show up they did and same it's like the same [ __ ] that people they're they're upset at the media upset at the control they're upset at the censorship and I didn't know like Jeff bezo I was in Norway and they're like yeah Jeff Bezos owns the freaking media here too I'm like what I didn't know I never thought about like that of course they would of course of and so and everybody's going through the same [ __ ] London Sweden Denmark uh Norway they're all [ __ ] pissed off like like I am and they're like all sick of being lied to and they're all they all hate their media and they all feel controlled that's what's good about today because before the media used to do exactly what they're doing now but they didn't it wasn't transparent right nobody knew right well there used to be 50 giant media companies so there used to be more truth that could get out but now because of Bill Clinton and the tel Communications act in 1996 we went from 50 giant media companies down to six meaning that every TV show every newspaper every magazine every radio show every it's all comes from one of the six companies right and that's why journalism sucks so much right now cuz journalists used to come from blueco collar backgrounds like me but now they uh they know they all have to work for one of the 6 billionaire owned companies and so the billionaires handpick those people from IV League schools now and they're all going to be class loyal and so that's why the whole thing is you know it's a great time but also we're pitted against each other now by the media like never before right like no matter what the story is they have their minions in the Press reported in a way that makes you hate your neighbor and blame your neighbor and not the guys doing it right like uh so so the oligarchy gets keeps us fighting amongst each other and that's real that is that's not made up that's a I mean look at how they lied about um the biggest story like so the Kyle Written House story right now I hated that kid cuz uh the corporate media told me he was a white supremacist who didn't live in that Community he traveled across state lines with guns to shoot three black people at a black lives matter rally and I hated him and then I watched the trial and it turns out he did live in that Community he was a a lifeguard in that Community uh he was asked to protect a car dealership by immigrants of color because the cops wouldn't and uh he he didn't travel across state lines with guns and he didn't shoot three black people he shot three white people and I was like I think he only shot two guys that uh maybe you're right maybe well he killed one he definitely and then he shot the other guy in the through the arm yeah uh and they're all three criminals that's another part they leave out they're three criminals terrible people this is the thing about um riots right when riots are too much like a war like uh any kind anytime there's a gathering protests when people get angry and they're marching I think that ignites in us the same feelings of war and people start doing wild crazy [ __ ] they went after that dude with a skateboard and tried to hit him with a skateboard he ran away from them before he shot him so he shot the first guy who was the pedophile right and and we know that that guy had threatened to so he shot and killed two men wounded another man so so he killed two and wounded one so the and the first guy he shot with had threatened to kill him all day long and we know that he attacked him because his fingerprints are on the gun barrel it even says it right there in wikip stop go back yeah grab the barrel of his right rifle there it is but it says look at this a race was a major theme in the US media commentary although written in house and those he shot were white were white is that wild yes most people didn't know including people that met Kyle ritten like someone David Lucas the standup comedian he knows Kyle written house he brought Kyle Written House to the Mothership and guys who were there who met him when what the guys you shot were white yeah like everybody's like what and then you have to tell them not only were they white like these guys are like career criminals one one guy was a pedophile the one guy pulled a gun on him yeah the the media just [ __ ] that kid and he won he won and he got exonerated and you know now go ahead no people say him they go Jimmy why why are you defending Kyle Rittenhouse I go I'm not defending Kyle Rittenhouse I don't know Kyle Rittenhouse uh I'm defending the truth and why aren't you pissed off that the corporate media lied about a 16-year-old kid to divide the country cuz that's what that was about yeah and you're just going to polarize that kid even more I mean that kid's going to lean so far right now of course of course they're the only people that stood by him and everybody else lied about him the media lied about him and so many people had this so right there's surface narratives right and surface narratives are the best the the media is the best at propagating surface narratives they're best at headlines even if they're misleading safe and effective yeah the but these these surface narratives are the ones that get into people's heads that are the least informed and that's the general population people still think R Russia Gates real oh yeah look at people like Bill Maher oh yeah that was shocking to me I'm like Oh I thought he just hated Trump but he doesn't even know what the WF is all he didn't even did you see Roseanne had to tell him he didn't even know what Mk Ultra was that's crazy like that's crazy and then he got the balls and tell Bill Bird this isn't your lane it's not your lane either bill you don't know [ __ ] anything bro Bill chewed him up that was wild you can't you can't go tat tatat like that with Bill cuz he does that to himself all day all day he's like battling out in his own mind having argues well look at you [ __ ] bill look at you you [ __ ] stupid sneakers on you 55 years old dress like a teenager what the [ __ ] are you doing what' you ever do why people listen to you you're [ __ ] [ __ ] you're not a general you never did anything exactly exactly but that's the that's the you know uh the biggest shocker to me was is like it the bubble that people live in right and it's like don't you it's just like with the debate like do you think that the the lies that the media has been telling from I've been saying Joe Biden's Been A demented walking death rattle since 2019 and it's because it's been obvious that he's suffering from something well there's a decline right if you just saw him in 2019 he wouldn't be as obvious but if you saw him from like when he was running for president in 1988 which I did I did I ever tell you about Joe Biden night that we used to have at stitches no stitches comedy club in 1988 we had Joe Biden night and what is that that would mean I would go on stage and do your act and you would go on stage and do my ACT plagiarist exactly so we would call it Joe Biden night and all the comics would go up and do each other's acts that sounds like fun it was fun it was so so fun cuz just like some guys you know you watch a guy like Jimmy tingle or you know back in those days Steve Sweeney you get to you could go up and do theiry and the guys you work with all the time where you got to see their set all the time you you go up and do their act and we had a great time but it was a open mockery that he was a known plagiarist in ' 88 in ' 88 I know that's why this whole this Rehabilitation it's all because of trump derangement syndrome that they have to pretend like Joe Biden's some kind of guy with integrity and dignity instead of you know the horrible criminal anti-worker guy that he's been his whole life he's been anti-student anti- worker and he he crossed a goddamn Railroad Strike and everybody just memory holds that that that happened like he if if Trump did that they would it would be on billboards forever and uh again it's it's what Joe why do you think that the because my whole life The Establishment loved Donald Trump right because the only option is if you don't go with Biden then you're not with the democ rats and the Democrats view themselves as a team they view themselves as a team as much as Patriots think of America first it's like that team is Democrats first and that's the only representation they have right now like apparently now I don't know if this is true but someone was telling will you telling me about this Jamie about the live streaming of uh was it you or was it someone else of Rob Riner and all these people oh they earlier too like I'll find the story they were all live streaming the debate and freaking out Barb St said's crying these people are deranged these people are no different than the Manson family in that they are in a cult yeah they're locked into this ideology it's not as bad as a mans and family but it's clearly a a cult it's an ideological cult where you're not willing to go against any of the doctrines of the cult and one of the do you're not allowed to you're not allowed to have you have to practice group think and that's yeah and Bill Mah is a heretic even though he's like he's very much a liberal he's a heretic because he says cuz every once in a while he'll tell the truth a lot of times he's just he's not as informed as I'd like him to be about some of the stuff like MK Ultra the W or Ukraine well I don't know what he knows about Ukraine but he hates Donald Trump but I think I couldn't figure it out on the pocket he wouldn't even like have a rational discussion as to why he hates him he's crazy yeah but the thing he I found out that he was sued by Donald Trump yes so that's that was that's probably it cuz when he said that Donald TR uh he was an orangutang and um though so he sued him Hollywood Holly debate watch party with Rob r j Fonda ended in shouts and tears that should have been [ __ ] Keeping Up with the Kardashians that should be the [ __ ] the the real and that's what you and I say good for you that's what you get for [ __ ] lying they they've all lied you know I think the media took just as big a hit as Joe Biden did that night because now I mean just a few weeks ago there's that Joe Scarboro that mental case on Morning Joe on MSNBC and he was saying let me tell you something if you don't believe it Fu he says this on 6 in the morning this is what he's telling his audience Fu this is the best version of Joe Biden I've ever seen he saw that right this the best and then like let's play it let's play it cuz it's amazing it's it is amazing wasn't he a Republican and they and they yes and they say that Trump is the liar it's like they are right now in the middle of telling the biggest lie that's ever been told in Poli this is bigger than FDR can walk this is bigger than that Hampton real estate is not not cheap and you got to do some things maybe you don't want to do if you want to buy that sweet house and just drink your Champagne by the lake just looking or the bay rather just looking over in the ocean going I [ __ ] made it baby I'm here in the Hamptons and that's yeah that's it's I'm about to go to dinner with Rob Riner hey [Music] I've I've always you know I've always said hey I don't I don't know if I'm better or worse than those people but uh you know uh I I've never had no one ever made an offer to sell to buy me out so I don't know how I would react I don't think it's a buy out or a sellout thing man that's a thing that people think I think what happens is you get in locked into a cult and then I think also you get invited to things with important people and that 100% will shape the way you talk about stuff if you get invited to a dinner with Bill Gates and you know some very important people when their name comes up you're going to defend them well uh Barack Obama talked about how just being in the room with the donor class changes you just being in the room with and I Chris Hayes wrote a book called The Twilight of the elite about how all that how that happens and then and then he became the thing he wrote about it's unbelievable yeah I don't know much about that don't you think it's amazing how um they fired all the they fired the the Arab reporters and the Muslim reporters at MSNBC because they were they were telling a little bit of the truth about what's happening or they were confronting people over it and uh yeah you have to have one one narrative and that's that's it and then and then but none of the like you there supposed to stand up for these why didn't Rachel mat say something why didn't Chris Hayes that they none of them said anything none of them fake tough guy Lawrence o donnald none of them said anything they just okay well keep your head down and keep taking it you know you know Rachel mat gets paid $100,000 a day like to me I don't know that's a lot of money good for her that's a good you could buy a lot of mans suits with that money you when she was being interviewed by uh Ben um who's the what's his name Ben uh the the guy who did Tropic Thunder Ben uh what's Ben Ben tiller they were wearing the exact same suit of course of course they that's one way that for whatever reason hardcore lesbians when they want to be taken seriously they dress like a man and they dress like a man in a business outfit yeah like Hannah Gatsby okay look how she dresses she puts a suit jacket on she's fantastic I'm serious I'm here for the meeting I'm here to explain things to you people he look at Jo what does he say the one you're looking for let me hear it start your tape right now cuz I'm about to tell you the truth F you if you can't handle the 6 in the morning at 600 in the morning F you this version of Biden intellectually analytically is the best Biden ever not a close second I've known him years the pinis have known him for 50 years and we're all [ __ ] Liars I wouldn't say it and these people say that Trump's a liar that's a I mean Trump's a huge bullshitter for sure but this we're in a Cohen Brothers movie yeah this is unbeliev and so how can if you can you imagine the I don't know how many people watch that show but 45 people can you imagine still tuning in after that yes I I would [ __ ] wake and bake and let's go tell me about the world Joe I used to watch I used to before I went to sleep I used to I would I would be up I was I used to be a nightall when I was just a comedian before my show and uh so I like I would wait till 3: in the morning I'd be up late I'm like oh I I can wait I can watch Joe scarbo before I go to bed Morning Joe so and the joke I used to do is I I watch it before I go to bed because I like to go to bed angry and uh that I don't know how anybody could watch that again after that how could you could you and have any self-respect unless it's you know you're you're high and you're enjoying it so you have to be high and enjoying it and then it becomes High comedy because it's so good that was so good that was so good that you if you put that in a movie people wouldn't buy it they would go come on no that's not real no one would do that this is stupid I'm I've lost my disbelief F you he's going to tell his own audience F you if you don't believe Joe Biden's not to yeah if I was in a movie theater my suspension of disbelief would go come on this is I'm that's why I was confused when I was looking there's other videos I'm seeing that might have been a different time and that was just a few weeks ago but this is saying right here post a debate and he's saying like they should replace after the debate Chang that's part of the so that was right before that was like we that was weeks before the debate he's saying that I'm like can you believe the balls on these crazy balls and so then after the debate he does this 180 and there's all these videos that show him before and after the greatest 180 turnaround of all time so if you go to the one up there with the black and white Joe and then I just that's the one show that it's only 30 seconds watch this but iold him when I said he was cogent Cent he's far beyond cogent oh he's be in fact I think he's better than he's ever been this is a battle for the future of American democracy and now is a good time in June thank God in June and not October in June this is a last chance for Democrats to decide whether this man we've known and loved for a very long time is up to the task so that that's that's just a matter of weeks in between those two Joe F you and I wouldn't say it if it wasn't the truth okay now we could thank God we can replace them but well here's why I have a theory about this by the way okay so they've never done presidential debates this early in the election season before right and so my theory is that his his own team sabotaged him knew this so they wanted to get Joe Biden through the primary because now all the delegates are beholden to Joe Biden means they're beholden to the Democratic party donor class right yes so there's no there isn't no 50% Bernie sander delegates out there right they're they're not going to have any trouble getting them to all coales at the convention and pick a new person so they wanted to get Joe Biden to go through and then as soon as he got through the thing they're like oh let's have a debate and then they knew he would look like this so then they can have enough time to get rid of him that that's that seems pretty plausible that that's what's going to happen and guess what's going to happen now so they're going to have a person at the top of the ticket who nobody voted for because they're going to choose them at the convention and nobody voted for this person and they're saying democracy's on the ballot that's the irony isn't that wild yeah well not only that but what did they do to keep RFK JR out of the primaries to the point where he had to go independent so yeah they were making it impossible for for him to get on ballots they were they were they were they how do that you know what I had he told me but I can't remember but they were making it well when I remember the first time I had him on my show I was I was it was like a joke I'm like dude you're running as a Democrat I go why do you think they have superdelegates they have superdelegates for people like you it's not going to happen I can't get excited about your candidacy and so what anything he said I I just didn't get into it right I was appreciative of the stuff he was saying around covid and things like that but it it was just I told him it's a Fool's errand right and he's like I'm a Democrat I've always been a Democrat I'm a Democrat and I'm like yeah the Democrats are going to screw you and they did and so I don't know exactly how but it got so untenable that he couldn't run inside the because they would have these different rules that they were just making up just to screw him now do they do this once there's an incumbent right once there's a president in place do they do this because there's so many jobs that are completely dependent upon that guy being in office not just the Democratic party but that guy so if a new guy comes in like if RFK Jr comes in if he wins then everyone's out of a job oh yeah yeah well uh the whole machine's out of a job so we it's very clear watching Joe Biden talk very clear that he's not making all his decisions and someone writes his stuff down we've seen the Q cards that he has they tell him what to say we see him read teleprompters and say end of quote you know he says things like that he just did it again just did it again does it all the time we so we know that there's no [ __ ] way he's the The Man Behind the the machine so that means there's a bunch of people that work for him that are essentially running the country right and those people don't want to lose that position including his wife his wife apparently by all takes and she did an interview afterwards where she said he's smarter than he's ever been and I know him I see him buying closes she doesn't want him to stop pure evil what is that that's just pure evil I mean do you think it's just like a power thing she's in power she doesn't want to not be the first lady anymore like what is it yeah of course I that's what I think it is well how could you not have compassion for your own freaking husband I mean Jesus Christ I mean uh he should have had his keys taken away years ago and here she is trying and you did a good job you answered all the question that's how you talk to a three-year-old she he answered all the questions I could see answering one or two but all of them if my wife talked to me like that I would just start laughing cuz I think oh she's [ __ ] with me I wouldn't just stand there like be yes I did it's a wild video Play that video Play that video of Jill saying that to Joe because it's I save and by the way I listened to the debate again on the plane uh why didn't [ __ ] get the bur in information from round one like I need to go over this with a fine tooth comb because that because they kept saying that oh because the the the line now is that Joe uh might not have answered the questions you know like uh uh quickly or loudly but he was telling the truth the his first answer he lied three times Joe Biden he lied about the medicare's was it's $2,000 he said it was2 200 he lied about the diabetes and he lied about Trump saying the bleach thing Trump never said the bleach thing he was talking about ultraviolet irid which is a real thing that actually works it actually works and not only that they they've used it for decades for yeah but um and they there was talk about using it for respiratory diseases and Shining Light into the lungs I've so I um i' talked to a doctor who told me that um that that worked well and so the uh the people like the the Medical Association they came to they go hey you have to sell this technology to us and uh and he said no and they well if you don't we're going to have a [ __ ] study that says this doesn't work and that's exactly what they did wow and they do that to everything let's play this real quick you did such a great job you answered every question you knew all the bro and let me ask the crowd look at him standing did Trump do why oh bro he looks so baffled first of all if I was in his Corner first thing I would have done is given him a hairpiece let's go bro I I wish you can't compete with Trump's wacky hair you need fake hair you need fully fake hair I think they'll buy it don't don't even sweat it we're going to glue a a nice piece on you and you're going to have a distinguished head of hair second of all whoever the [ __ ] is giving your Botox back off a little let the guy move the forehead a little bit this is ridiculous you're not tricking me into thinking he's young I know exactly how old he is go go go to the watch how she oh no that's not it she helps him off the stage yes this is it watch she has to walk him down the steps are they going to show it show it well yeah he's he's got some bad knees show it old war injuries bro yeah yeah yeah he defending the Girl Scouts from the Taliban look at this yeah look at this I know it's crazy he has to go sideway if you don't think that's the best version [ __ ] you Joe f you f f you guy because he's the tough guy Democrat he's a no no no he's a Democrat he's on TV on CNBC MSNBC whatever it is yeah well that that just goes to show you that there is there's no difference between the parties and I remember when Donnie deuts uh accidentally let it slip out on Joe scarber's show that is Joe Scarboro actually a republican he was he was a republican Congressman but does he consider himself one now I I think so for real I I mean just like a never Trump never Trump Republican yeah and Donnie do said that uh I remember uh if if Bernie Sanders wins the this was in back in 2020 if Bernie Sanders wins he I'll have to vote for Trump and joose garell was like do you hear what you're saying and D's like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know why I said that I know why you said that cuz you [ __ ] would that's why they they they they scared of Bernie PE people who Bernie Sanders presents as being turns out Bernie Sanders isn't that guy Bernie Sanders is a lap dog to power but but he didn't he just seemed to become that as of recently yeah uh I mean I think he always was he was when you go back in time and you know he didn't um he stopped talking to Ralph nater he stopped talking to uh Michael parente uh he was for the bombing of Kosovo he's always been a little [ __ ] for the military-industrial complex and he it's disgusting and so when if you really look yeah I got so excited about Bernie Sanders right I mean know was so I've never been more excited about a politician in my life and I've never been more let down by a politician in my and they lied about the cares act and he lied about putting oh we had to do it for the unemployment like that was just the largest you know that was the largest uper transfer of wealth in human history was the car's act and they that's a uh and nobody talks about that explain the car's act to people so that was when right when covid hit and they passed that $5 trillion uh Bill $5 trillion just out of nowhere they didn't go they didn't go tax people for it they just [ __ ] printed it $5 trillion and that was considered the largest upward Trend so that's remember and none of them there was no money in there for to for pay people's salaries remember like that's what other countries did what did the 5 trillion go towards uh went towards the Thousand richest [ __ ] in the country basically that's what you know that's where you got the you could if you had a business you could apply for a what is that some kind of pp loan and stuff like that a lot of people scam those loans a lot of people I've seen so many arrests of people that bought Lamborghinis and [ __ ] you got one of them I was like [ __ ] everybody else is getting one I better get one wow and uh I was like I I told pay your staff like yeah I told my wife I go I don't I we don't know what's going to happen so I said hey apply see what happens they gave it it they gave it to us I was like what I couldn't [ __ ] believe it so you have to pay it back is that what it is no it's just free money no if you don't if you don't lay off anybody like for a certain amount of time then you get to keep it but if you did yes you just get free money yeah whoa yes everybody got [ __ ] it was $5 trillion they gave out Joe yeah and they gave it out probably companies that didn't lose profit uh I bet yeah right so if they didn't if they didn't fire companies and it didn't stop operations I wonder if I if somebody should look into how much did Amazon get did they get money did they get that kind of money even though they're smart they got paid they're this's a dirty corrupt system they're a part of it let's go let's party I I think we can bust this move out everybody's sick but don't you think the care it's called the car's act it's called the The Patriot what aren't you a patriot and they say yeah AR you a patriot Jimmy you don't care about America why you care about America or not why do you hate Freedom yeah why do you hate Freedom you won't sign the Patriot Act called that it's called The Patriot Act the most nail likee thing ever the government can now spy on you the Patriot Act too okay you're thinking of the Patriot Act too okay electric Baloo or the National Defense authorization act oh yeah those ones they passed through the in the 2011 uh ndaa uh section 1021 Barack Obama got rid of habius Corpus that's not important what's really important is that we get these trillionaires all their money for Co got rid of habius Corpus joke so now I mean habius Corpus was in the Magna Carta mhm so now we're operating on a Liberty View from somewhere around the 1100s that's that's and people don't democracy on the ballot you [ __ ] Mo democracy hasn't been on the ballot for decades and decades you don't live in a democracy you live in an oligarchy which was proven by a Princeton study over 10 years ago and uh when are you going to get pissed off about that no no because the TV guy says no no it's the Joe Biden's democracy and Trump isn't and and don't you love all that [ __ ] about how oh he'll never leave office I didn't know that was an option I didn't know a president could just decide to not so every president has left office just because they're good people just because they decided to oh he's going to be a dictator I didn't know a president I thought we had co-equal branches of government how is this all [ __ ] they just say this [ __ ] and it's none of it's true and I'll just make it he was already president one time he left office yeah we already lived through it everybody's pretending that if he gets into office he's going to be the horrible thing that they predicted that didn't take place when he was in office for four years what evidence are you basing this on the evidence that when he was in Pre when he was actually the president and he was for four [ __ ] years right like you're he did none of those things he didn't prosecute his political Rivals he didn't go after Clinton he even though she's a super criminal remember remember the FBI the Comey guy came out and he said uh yeah this is going to sound crazy in a couple of different ways but yes we found hundreds of uh of a high Lev documents secret uh classified documents on her server but you know we're not going to prosecute her I know this is going to sound weird do you remember that yeah I do they made a somebody made a hilarious video out of it they put it to music it was weird at the beginning because a lot of people myself included saw him firing Comey I'm like whoa you're going to fire the head of the FBI because he doesn't like you like that's crazy that's crazy and's a piece of [ __ ] because of that what I was going to say is because of that happening it caused so many people to start going what has the FBI done like what are they doing and then you start reading stories and you start understanding the history of it and you're like oh what what do they what did they do what have they been involved in I know what I know what good things a lot of good things there's a few like whenever with any kind of large organization was a lot of competitive people rise to the top you're going to get unscrupulous fellas sociopaths to the top yeah and they're going to do some things and if they're in high positions of power and they can manipulate everyone around them to go with it that's what you get you get in every human situation where people are what you get you get January 6th that's what you get you get uh you get Russia gate I know the I know that the FBI lied to the fisa court 17 times so they could get a tap on Brock on Donald Trump's phones that happened they lied to the fisac CT 17 times no nobody talks about that nobody pays a price for that uh they they did it to the goddamn you know you know I'm sure you saw the video of when Chuck Schumer was on with uh Rachel mattow and he says well talking about Trump yeah that uh he's being really dumb to uh to criticize the intelligence Community meeing the CIA and the FBI and R says why and he says cuz uh they've got six ways this Sunday to mess with you back so what he really was saying there that that was the leading Democrat in the Senate the leader of the party he was telling people in a into a camera that the president that that the CIA and the FBI doesn't work for the president that he has to worry about them and if they don't work for the president who the [ __ ] do they work for Joe right exactly and of course Rachel M never asked that question she's never going to do that because you know she's a a lap dog of the military-industrial complex Wall Street Big Pharma all of them they're all the same it was it's a natural thing that takes place when any organization gets extreme power and that was supposed to be mitigated right and that this is like the problem that Kennedy had with secret societies this is the problem that Kennedy had with the CIA and what Kennedy had with the NSA this these you when you ever get people that are above everything like this concept of the deep State you put your tin foil hat on when you just say the word deep State everybody who is not paying attention people that are just reading mainstream news you say deep State they oh god he's a q andon guy I got get out of here the Deep State's real and it's real it's the intelligence community and Chu Schumer said they don't work for the president well what I so they don't and they don't they don't and so they I mean they would even brag about it when Trump first became president they would go on a Comey and other people would go on interviews and they would say you know Mr President we're going to be here long we were here before you we're going to be here after you yeah so they don't give a [ __ ] about the pre I mean they're just saying it out loud they would say it out loud and so yeah so people are conditioned but isn't that just what happens when you have competitive human beings locked into these organizations that have extreme power it's just you you're always going to have that with human beings these are like human behavior patterns that they always follow it's that just like our country is ending the way all Empires end we overextend ourselves militarily which is brings me to uh by what is that you're smoking it's a cigar oh really when I don't want a full cigar I smoke one of these little tiny Monte kristos it's a little baby cigar you want a cigar I'll smoke a real one with you no I did that once and it made cuz I used to smoke cigarettes and I'm like oh I can everybody started smoking cigars at one time when I first moved to Los Angeles I was like oh I could smoke cigars These are nice ones cuz Ron White turned me onto these it woke up the Beast and I started smoking cigarettes again yeah no good so I can't do it I even quit smoking pot recently in last last September heard I heard you did yeah I watched that video I thought it was really interesting oh makes people sad when I say it on stage that's silly that's silly people go oh it makes them upset and I'm like you know it it it really woke me up to a lot of I don't know I don't even people go why why' you quit I don't even know why I quit like I feel like it was uh I think it came from a higher power yeah I know you're were saying that too I'm going to get a cigar while we're talking you're going to get a real cigar a real cigar oh okay what made you go from the I want a little one to a big one just now we're going to talk about something serious oh okay I like God damn it it smells well the thing that why I stopped is cuz it smells so [ __ ] good and I yeah but I I see your point is though and I see what you're saying and there's a thing that can happen with marijuana or with anything that alters your State of Consciousness including coffee cigarettes alcohol everything is you're using that to sort of cope and exist and you're not you're not really being present you're always being present under the influence of these things and I've been guilty of that myself you know just sometimes you just want to catch a buzz just want don't want to be here I just want to have a couple of whiskies I don't want be here I want to be here but just be you know it's like sometimes the world's overwhelming and I think you miss a lot if you live in that state you miss a lot like one of the things that happens with people that uh have drug problems when they're young is they don't really mature properly because they spent you know 15 16 17 doing math doing coke partying and then by the time they get clean and sober like they are grownup babies yes that's well they say that they say that when your addiction starts you stop you get locked into that level of maturity that you're at until your addiction ends yes and then you start growing but now you're growing in a confused State and you've also got this anxiety it's sometimes crippling because if you wasted a giant chunk of your life and not made any progress and here you are a beginner at 35 years old and you're out here in the world trying to like get a regular job at 35 and nobody wants to hire you because you've been in 15 rehabilitation centers and you you got locked up for stealing hubc caps catalytic inverters or whatever it's like the the thing that it does to you is it it's separates you from normal reality and that could be a positive or A negative if you have discipline and control and you're present and you really spend a lot of time thinking Alone by yourself and meditating you can use things to alter your State of Consciousness to achieve new thoughts you you tap into new ideas pot pot helped me a lot comedically it it's comedy steroids yeah it it was a big it was a big deal for me uh it it took me from being I was a very narrow and rigid comedian and then it opened me up and it made me a much better comedian as all I can say and it worked for a long time and uh it didn't like take away my discipline like I still had lots of discipline comedically and then doing my when I started my podcast in 2008 or n and then my radio show and then the so it never I was always you're OG 2008 or 9 you're up there with me then we were like at the same time yep I I started um with Todd Glass I started a show called comedy and everything else and we would interview Comedians and then um I did like 152 episodes of that and I just got tired of it and then I started doing the Jimmy door show because I got a radio show on kpfk in Los Angeles which is a public radio show so it's all politics and comedy you know and so I just shifted over to that and um it was it was a pretty popular still is the pop I mean it would get like 50 to 60,000 downloads per episode but it never sold tickets it's the weirdest thing and um when I went on YouTube that was immediately I started selling tickets immediately immediately no and that's you know as you know that changes your whole life yeah the YouTube thing uh that's a different world everybody has it it's it's on every phone it's on everybody if you have Apple TV people I I watch YouTube more than I watch Netflix oh no doubt oh no doubt yeah because if I watch Netflix it's like I want to watch peaky blinders I sit down and watch it you know but if YouTube's like let me just [ __ ] around see what's going on in the world of ancient archaeology let me watch a professional pool match let me see this new muscle car build I get lost for hours if my if I want to zone out if I'm exhausted and I just want to zone out I've did everything that I have to do I just want to just chill YouTube I go right to YouTube yeah so hey Jimmy door what's he talking about oh I didn't know that and then I'm watching you yell at Cornell West or some other [ __ ] person and I'm like this is aaz Jimmy's a Mad Dog I love how mad I love having Kurt on the show because he gets upset you know and sub and then like I get to be amused by instead of me getting upset yes oh it's a perfect balance Kurt sitting there going get everything's a [ __ ] s and everything your whole life everything in the world okay everything that's like like at at the two and a half hour mark of the show everything every [ __ ] thing everything and I just I just it gives me joy so you were saying before I interrupted you that you think that it was a higher calling that like quitting quitting pot so I started um and when Co happened I started uh getting into Carl Yung and my unconscious and analyzing my dreams and then I realized that the um that there is what Carl Young calls God is a transpersonal self and um that he's the one who kind of figured out we have a collective unconscious that we're all so there only is one conscious I mean you've done DMT and all [ __ ] so you get all that but he he was able to give himself like a mushroom trip when he was conscious without taking mushrooms right and he would call it active imagination so he could go into his unconscious and confront all these things that like archetypes and God that lives in your unconscious and he had to have a person that was there to make sure he didn't go crazy and um so he did this for like four years from like 1913 to 1917 and he wrote it down in a thing called the Red Book which he would not allow to be published for 50 years after he died because he knew if people read it it would discredit his work in Psychology because it sounds crazy all the [ __ ] it's like it's like he had mushroom trips and he would write it down right but it was real and so what he did so during those four years he then spent the rest of his life trying to explain to people what he had learned in those four years uh in on in ways that they could understand it and so that's what the rest of his life was about and um they asked him I remember they asked him um do you do do you believe in God he says I don't believe in God I know and I was like man that's badass when you can say [ __ ] like that and so anyway I started to get into this and so he figured out that there was we have a collective unconscious because he would see these symbols in his dreams and he knew that they were like meaningful but he didn't know what they meant and then he started to study Alchemy which Alchemy isn't what you think it is alchemy was about turning a psychological lead into psychological gold and they were onto a lot of [ __ ] and they had to keep it secret because of the church I guess and so they had to speak in code kind of and so he started to read Alchemy and he started to see these symbols that were in his dreams that they had written about and they had already figured out what it meant and he was like well how the [ __ ] could I have a dream about some I didn't know any I never read this book before I don't know what how is and that's how he started to figure that out and so that [ __ ] has happened to me I'll see symbols in my uh in my dreams I this happened so I I I I was um this going to sound crazy uh so I'm in the jungle in a clearing and this uh this creature comes over to me it looks like a big ape his body's like an like a big gorilla but his head is like half of a lion half human and I'm like what the [ __ ] and and he puts hand out I'm like oh he's going to crush me so I but I put my hand in his hand and he took my hand gently and he walked me into the jungle and I was like what the so I tell this to my I have an analyst who yian analyst who helps me decipher what my dreams mean and uh and he said you know that's an archetypal God and that um that was them telling you it's time for you to go into the jungle of your unconscious but you'll be safe if you long and I was like oh so then like like a month later I'm reading this book book and um there's that [ __ ] thing the ape with the line I'm like there's a like what that's the thing I saw my dream like how did that show up in my dream before I ever saw it before or knew I had the so I'm having the exact same is there a drawing of this in Young's book or is it just description in Young's book it's called a mithraic god there that's what uh that's what I uh I I come to know I was like that's the [ __ ] thing that was in my dream so there's also another thing called the old man so car young talked about this a lot like he would meet the old man in his dream which was like uh a transpersonal self of God yeah like that that's it wow yeah so that's an archetypal character yeah I'm like how the [ __ ] did that and you had no idea and that thing showed up never seen it yeah wow so that's depicted all throughout history it looks like I had no idea so how bizarre I had this big decision to make my life and um it it was so what what Carl Young says is that you're unconscious you're transpersonal self will create a scenario for you where there's no way out there's no no matter which way you go you lose so I was in one of those and I had had a dream and um I'm standing in line at a Starbucks at at a at an airport and this guy Taps me and I and I see a short cut so whenever there's a shortcut I I'm going to get I'm going to cuz it's a long line and so I figured out I can go in over here and I can sneak and get in and get my coffee first you know and so I'm I'm like doing that and all of a sudden this Taps and it's the old man with the gray hair that Carl Young had talked about I didn't know it at the time and I just thought this and this old man he didn't say anything to me it's like he just grabs my hand and he points to the end of the long line and I go [ __ ] you old man get away from me what the [ __ ] do you know and uh whoa yeah well now I so I eventually did take the long line in my in my not in the dream but in my life and as soon as I did every so Carl Young has another saying he says you the biggest problems in your life can never be solved they can only be outgrown and so I grew that I was like oh so it it happened like it and so I've had these experiences of so what but but you didn't finish that thought like what was wrong with the back of the line like what did you realize by going to the back of the line uh it's like I I don't want it's it's a little personal so like about the the situation in my Waking Life um but I just knew that I had I what I had to do then right once I realized that that oh the old man that was my transpersonal self telling me you got to do this and I'm and so it it I had a had an Awakening I outgrew this problem because you know was it was like they you know uh my my my yion analyst refers to it as you know you're on a crucifix right now and the only thing you can do is hold maintain don't make a decision don't do one thing or the other just hold and then something will appear and that that that's what appeared it was in my dream it coincided with the synchronicity in me reading a book about what I was supposed to do I'm like holy [ __ ] what do you think dreams are so I think it's a mistake to dismiss them I think dreams are the same Consciousness that creates this Waking Life creates your your dream life right and they're important and if the more attention you pay to them uh the more you'll get out of them and the more it'll rise up to meet you and so I keep a dream journal I write down every dream I have and uh you'll start to see patterns uh and it it's I've I've had uh so I was reading this book called the Undiscovered self by Carl Jung and it's amazing how it fits what's happening right now today right and I tried to get to Bobby Kennedy to read it with me but um he says in there you know how during covid how comedians flipped and all of a sudden you weren't allowed to question you know I do that bit about that that you quoted before and you're not allowed to question and think for yourself and it used to be called reading yeah it used to be called reading don't do your own research this just reading so now they're shaming me for reading right so uh Carl Carl Young talks about that you you have a a need you have a psychological need for to have a an experience of the Divine and a deity and all that stuff and if you don't have that you're going to create it and so that's how those people when I'm reading this book I'm like oh that's what they did with Co they turned fouchy into a god they turned science into a religion right that you can't question it right they're archetypes right so that I'm like what so that so they just projected so Carl Young's all about projection that we're projecting all the time and that's how we get to know ourselves right so like when you fall in love with someone that's that's the big his big one is that you have a feminine side inside of you and it's called your anima if you're a guy and if you're a female you have a male and that's called your animus and when you fall in love with someone like oh you know that thing like oh my God I can't live without this person this is the thing I've been looking for that's when you project that part of yourself that's in your unconscious onto that person and so that's a real religious experience because you're rejoining with religion meaning to rejoin you're joining your conscious self with your unconscious self and that's why it feels like you're being stimulated from the inside cuz you are and you feel this Oneness and this Hess and if I lose this person I'll die right and so that is what most people that's why guys in their it happens to guys in their 50s and that's why a lot of guys leave their wife and they go for that's It's [ __ ] amazing how that happens right so um that's so that's all projection and then eventually the projection falls off and then people get divorced right yeah interesting so the religious experience is the the combining of the two Souls the combining of your conscious self and your unconscious self right in someone else and and yeah so you and you experience it by projecting it on someone else so and that's that's the phenomen and no nobody knows that's the phenomena of Love of romantic love of romantic love right and there's this whole book um there's this there's this old um myth about Tristan and isal and I read this whole book by this yian scholar that explains what it's all about and you have to give up uh so by the way I meet my ANA in my dreams all the time and it's unbelievable it's [ __ ] unbelievable so they have different people's how often do you remember your dreams every day really yeah and so like to the point where if I'm going to have a session with my union analysis I'll take a nap and I know I'll have a dream or two and I'll wake up and I we talk about them I I I'm a good dreamer especially when you quit smoking pot and is that when the dream start started or did you have dreams while you were smoking pot I I had dreams while I was smoking pot but they're just more intense now then they got yeah after you quit smoking pot your dreams become Vivid and intense and over the top almost almost too much you know uh but now it's gone back to a normal level so let me ask you this again what do you think dreams are I think dreams are uh a spiritual uh whatever is in your spirit whatever is it's it's God for lack of a better better term trying to communicate with you and talk to you through symbols wow mhm that's what I think some mhm I mean I'm not an expert on this stuff I've just been into it for like the last four years M and I just know my experience and so it is very strange how and so if you don't have if you don't have an experience of the Divine you are going to create it and that's what people did during Co with science and fouchy and all that [ __ ] they they projected it onto that and luckily enough I've been having uh experiences of the Divine through my dreams and my dream analysis and then and then I also see it when you see synchronicities car Carl Young talked about synchronicities um which are coincidences that have meaning they're not just coincidences right so and you know and once you start to look for them you see you know it's like when you buy a new car you see that car everywhere it's like once you start to look for uh synchronicities they start to happen so then it's it's like I'm constantly in um communication with God that's how I that's how I for lack of a better word that's how I feel about it right and so everything hap that happens in my dreams and in my Waking Life comes from the same Consciousness Carl Young said that the future uh can be set up is set up by your unconscious long in advance which is why it can be guessed at by Clairvoyance so anyway so this book the red book that he wrote down his experiences of for those four years where he could give himself like a mushroom he uh it finally got published in 2010 and I'm not even able to read it like I just look at it's just like super confusing and it's looks like crazy talk so I what I do is I read books that he wrote up uh trying you know after he had that experience and I read books by other yian Scholars explaining [ __ ] because it's he's dense man it's very he puts a lot of info in a little bit like it took me a week just to I was reading a a book called The the mysterium kungo that he wrote and it took me like a week just just the opening paragraph just to keep going all like what the [ __ ] yeah I Tried reading his book on flying saucers oh really yeah what is uh Carl Young's book on flying saucers called but he had this concept about flying saucers he thinks they're they're constructs of the mind but not necessarily that they're not real it's a very strange Flying Saucer that's is it no it's a modern myth if you go to the back like go back to where you a modern myth of things seen in the sky oh really yeah I heard this see if you could find um just a synopsis what it just write what did Carl Young believe about UFOs see does it say here okay what does it say in late 50s the he of the popular fascination with UFO's flying saucers is the great psychologist brilliant preent meditation on the phenomenon that gripped the world a self- confess skeptic in such matters young was nevertheless intrigued not so much by the reality or unreality but by their psychic aspect he saw flying saucers as a modern myth in the making to be passed down the generations just as we have receive such myths from our ancestors in this wonderful and enlightening book young sees UFOs as Visionary rumors the center of a quasi religious cult and carriers of our technological and salvationist Fantasies 40 years later with entire religions based on the writings of science fiction authors it is remarkable to see just how right he has proven to be has proved to to be wow I'll have to read that book yeah I think the people the best book to start with Carl Young is me memories dreams Reflections which is his biography and he wrote mhm um and that that he he you know he let you in on a little because he was he was more than a psychologist he was a Mystic right and um it it's it's it's made all the difference in my life I was I was you know I considered myself a Sam Harris atheist I used to call myself you know because and that was mostly a reaction to me being brought up Catholic and so I was rejecting religion and but at the same time I was also rejecting spirituality and I didn't realize it but now because of this experience I realize oh no that that you know it's just terminology God is real uh there is the you know your ego doesn't control things your ego needs once you can make your ego uh subservient to the transpersonal self and your conscious uh that's the key to life the realizing that you're just you the way the way I describe it to people is that you know we're all part of Consciousness Consciousness is an ocean and then there's a huge way the part of the Consciousness we see is a is is the wave right and all I can do is surf that wave I can't create that wave I can't control it I can't all I can do is try to Surf it as best I can and by making yourself um you know subser your eag go subservient to and keeping your eye on the transpersonal center this is what Carl Young talks about that's kind of the key it's very unless you experience it it's hard to understand it's even for hard for me to explain it um yeah but it does make sense it's like trying to explain a DMT trip I'm guessing I've never done DMT it does make sense that a person like that that is trying to understand how the human mind works would have to take into account all sorts of bizarre things like UFO sightings psychic experiences dream states endogenous psychedelic experiences through like there's a bunch of different ways you can reliably achieve psychedelic states without any drugs one of them that I've done recently even is holotropic breathing and if you do holotropic breathing you have what's like almost like a mushroom trip what is that it's Google holotropic breathing so you can get an I don't butcher the definition of it but I also a lot of people do uh breathing exercises in sensory deprivation tanks which provides very Vivid psychedelic experiences with no drugs at all so this is I did my first breathing exercise ever this morning um this is just talking about the the study of it what there's a way to do maybe I said the wrong word so psych breathing to induce psychedelic States just write just write breathing to induce psychedelic States I might have used the wrong word all right here we go breathing their way to an altered state oh that's look at it's in the yes right there in fast New York Times January 10th so you know it's a lie okay what does it what does it say here so it's do they call it holotropic breathing or am I using the wrong terminology okay there it is vigorous modality known as holotropic breath work is offered at the end of an 8-month training 8 month before they get you the holotropic breathing to provide a lawful Taste of the therapeutic potential and pitfalls of Altered States Of Consciousness so Dr JJ purcel a naturopathic doctor from Oregon was amongst the trainees who walked uh into the early October session skeptical that a couple hours of intense Brea intense breathing could induce anything close to a psychedelic trip but she was stunned the depth of what I experienced was so similar to sosy and Dr purcel Marvel referring to the active compound in magic mushrooms it was trippy so you did that yeah I've done that a bunch of times and does it work yeah it definitely works especially Works in a tank or when you're lying in bed when you're you're quiet so you you just did a certain kind of breathing for hours Google like what is the protocol for psych for holotropic breathing there's just like a specific way you're supposed to do it but I can achieve some reasonable form of a psychedelic state by just con trting on breath I I have this thing that I do and I do it when I can't sleep where my mind is racing right so I force my mind to concentrate on one thing and that's in with the good out with the bad those are the only words I allow in my head so as I breathe in I go and I lose track I start thinking about oh I forgot to call that guy back I start thinking but then I get back to it in with the good out with the bad in with the good out with the bad and long bread like and when I'm doing that I'm only allowing those those words in my head I'm I'm the other ones are getting in there but I'm pushing them out get out of the door I'm The Bouncer and then eventually I can achieve this very strange State this very strange state that with your eyes closed you start seeing patterns you see this like weird sort of like Matrix like for lack of a better turn almost like a geometric grid of the world and you just keep con and usually I fall asleep when I'm doing that but I can stay awake and have it takes a while it might take 15 20 minutes of doing that but you you get in there and I know that people that do Kundalini Yoga um I have a friend who did Kundalini Yoga and he said and he has also done DMT he said it is the exact same place you can absolutely get there you just have to be rigorous you have to practice it for a long time but they have a specific type of like nodding and bobbing they do with intense breath work that gets you to this endogenous dump of psychedelic chemicals so one of the one of the reasons why it's so insane that that sweeping 1970s uh psychedelic Drug Act took place is not just that they used it to Target civil rights leaders and anti-war movement people and the Black Panthers and anybody that was inconvenient but also that it stopped us from being able to explore what these things are so the one of the terms that psychedelics use that people they talk about psychedelics it's one of the more lofty terms is entheogen and what entheogen means essentially it's like this is something that connects you to God like what is the uh what is the term entheogen what is an actual was a literal translation of enogen but that this is what they think here it is a chemical substance typically of plant Origins that is ingested to produce a non-ordinary state of cons ious for religious or spiritual purposes I think that's what most religions are based on I think they're based on either an understanding of how to achieve psychedelic States endogenously or people coming into contact with psilocybin amonita muscaria there there's a variety of different things that they probably came in contact with there's Scholars out of Jerusalem uh now that believe that the interpretation from Moses in the burning bush that that Burning Bush was probably the acacia tree and the acacia tree is rich in DMT now it just completely makes sense that burning a bush that is rich in DMT would connect Moses to God and God would give Moses these Commandments for how mankind should live that completely makes sense well it's probably a psychedelic experience and there's probably a bunch of different ways to get them I think that's what monks are doing when they're they're spending the entire day isolated and and meditating I think they're achieving very that's I think that's why they're willing to keep doing it I me that's why they're willing to stay everybody's like oh those poor bastards look at them no [ __ ] dressed like a [ __ ] like look at them this stupid [ __ ] orange robe but those people I think are connecting to something some other state that is more exciting than this one that we're kind of trapped in well I've had the experience of I've I've only done mild doses of mushrooms in my life maybe five or six times and the last time I did it I remember when I would close my eyes it it would seem more real than when I when I open my eyes was like oh everything seemed flat and uninteresting and when I closed my eyes I was like this is the real thing I'd like to stay here longer so it's got to be what you said that's why people are willing to sit in a cave and meditate every day and because it's more real it's a more it's a more it's a more like a rich experience I think we operate under the biological Dimension that's where our our our thing moves around under the biological Dimension and all of our senses are tuned into the biological Dimension because it rev it involves injury and death and illness and and crime and and Injustice and all these different things that can ah get you all ramped up in the biological Dimension but we're also connected to something else and you can Define that thing you can call it things you can call it Heaven The Well of Souls you can call it a bunch of different things I think calling it anything is a problem because we don't know what the [ __ ] it is but whatever it is I think there's a bunch of different ones and M teren Mna described it as a mandala like that there's like a mandala of different psychedelic experiences that the human body and the human mind is capable of experiencing and that there's all sorts of different ones have you're going to a different neighborhood and that these chemical gateways that get you into these states that's what these psychedelic drugs are we're looking at it like oh he's just escaping reality I think they're chemical gateways I think they're chemical gateways into other dimensions into some other realm that you cannot you cannot get there with this thing that's worried about oh I'm getting a belly uh to do this yeah ego and just the the reality of having to pay your bills and keep the lights on there's just like too much weird [ __ ] here that distracts you Joe Biden's fine he's the best version of Joe Biden never seen and you're driving to work on what I'm in the upside down world this is like [ __ ] stranger things like what is happening here this is crazy and you're losing your [ __ ] mind and that all this does all this chaos this is like if the devil and God were real this is chaos this is Hell the hell is this confusion and this this constant lack of peace no one's ever everyone's filled with anxiety well G Jesus said there's a quote um that the kingdom of my father is laid upon the Earth but the eyes of men don't see it so yeah that so we're creating our own hell right and it's I think overidentification with the ego mind you know which is different than you know you got you got a big ego that's different um the ego mind is like what you're conscious of your your idea of who you areh um and then the things that you don't like according to Young you split them off and you put them into your unconscious so when people who hate Trump like when you see people who have trumped Arrangements syndrome yeah that's because they're projecting that part of themselves that is like Trump onto him and so then they can hate that and that when you when you have a big reaction to something external whether it's you love something intensely or you hate something intensely that tells you it's about you MH that's about cuz and so like I never hated Trump I hated the system that got us Trump like that's I tried to keep my focus on you know it was because Barack Obama uh bailed out the banks and kicked 5.1 million families out of their homes and and then went on to give us a right-wing [ __ ] healthcare plan it was a giveaway to big farm and insurance company and he didn't really help that's what let made laid the groundwork for people to to go for someone like Trump that always does so that that's what I so when so when people hate the people who hate Trump the most are people who have split off that part of themselves that is Trump and put it in their unconscious and then they're experiencing themselves as they projected onto him we we you know those people I know a lot of those people you know like like uh like Rob Rob Riner you know like Bill Maher like um there's there's lots of those people everywhere yeah um and they you know then they just tell these fantasies about him he's never going to leave oh Robert Ziro yeah now Kur Kurt's convinced that Robert ziro's on some kind of Epstein list or some kind of thing like that and then he's afraid that when if Trump does get power he's going to expose him and he is actually going to come at him that's a course Kurt thinks that that's Kurt thinks that Kurt thinks that about every [ __ ] thing that happens in the world I think that uh I think Robinson just a got got trumped Arrangement syndrome I think he's old too there's a thing about old men they want to yell at everybody and he's completely did you see when he went and gave that speech outside of the tri that was bizarre who told him that was a good idea and then he starts yelling at regular people he's like [ __ ] you you're a gangster [ __ ] go [ __ ] you like it's crazy that that's the guy from Taxi Driver you have you know what also I think I think those guys have no friends I think the only friends they have are Hollywood phonies and and so you're in this weird world where everybody you talk to is a phony and you become a phony and everyone's a phony and your grasp on reality is very slippery and your eyes are going right so your vision of the world your actual vision of the world your ability to read a phone you ever see old people's text messages the [ __ ] text on their phone it's like as big as my hand it's crazy and so your vision of the world is blurring literally and figuratively and then you're getting old and when old people are tired and cranky they just want everyone to listen to them and they don't have time to have a calm conversation and you state out your opinion I'll State my opinion let's see where we have common ground get off my lawn and that's what he's doing that's what he's doing he's he's being this old grumpy man that is so lost that he thinks it's a good idea to stand in front of a bunch of people on the street and give a speech on camera about how bad Donald Trump is with all the [ __ ] that's going in the world that I know all the craziness of the world right now the guy you're voting for uh a lot of people consider is funding a genocide right so you don't think that's horrible you look what's again if he knew what was happening in Ukraine people more people being slaughtered in Ukraine For What and we just signed another 10 years of that yeah signed on for another 10 years worth what $800 billion so this is all money funneling operation that's what that's what Afghanistan was and as Julian Assan Pro uh or taught us that these wars aren't meant to be won they're meant to be ongoing they had a peace agreement you know that they had PE agreement almost immediately after the invasion the Russia invaded they had a peace agreement and that Ukraine agreed to it zinski agreed to it and they flew Boris Johnson out there and said don't [ __ ] you can't do this or we're going to kill you and so he did that's why he can't do it and and so that's why this war is ongoing and they have to rip people off corners and put them in Vans to go fight in this [ __ ] War the average age of the Ukraine military is over 40 years old have you seen the videos of guys getting kidnapped yes I can't it I can't even watch it guys with their families they just grab a guy they just grab them grab them and people are screaming they're throwing him in a van you're going to go fight in a war I think you lost the war when we already so they did so and then of course nobody knows how this war started you've had Dave Smith on he explained it yeah you know nobody nobody still to the state knows about the maidon coup that the United States got in bed with right-wing Nazis and Ukraine to overthrow a democratically elected government and then uh they started bombing the people in the east of Ukraine uh called the donbass and they wouldn't stop they had two peace agreements called the Minsk Accords guess who violated them that the Ukraine it wasn't that and and so you know uh I've heard people say that uh and of course it was the expansion of NATO right the threat of putting NATO on the border of Russia which everybody from Kissinger to Chomsky and everybody in between said that's a mistake don't do that that's of course what they're doing and so there's no what's the point of NATO anymore and then this whole idea they're doing the Domino Theory again oh well if he if we allow him to do this to Ukraine he's going to go to Poland next he go it's the same [ __ ] [ __ ] they said all the time it's the Domino Theory and again the world's terrorists are the United States States look what we did to Iraq look what we did to Libya Libya the most successful country in all of Africa the guy created the eighth wonder of the world with their the way how he delivered water and turn turned deserts into farmland and everybody had a house and everybody had education and health care and we turned it into a failed state run by by terrorists with open slave markets who did that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did that and they'll never have to pay a price for that Barack Obama the most he'll do is go y that was a mistake why did they get rid of uh Gaddafi because he was going to um start a a currency of Africa just for that was going to compete with the US dollar and the Euro and they can't have that because the way the United States controls the world is because the United States dollar is the reserve currency of the world so that's why they can put sanctions on all these countries and so what they're doing which they shouldn't do they're weaponizing the US dollar and so so like when countries want to trade with each other they have to go take their currency change it into US dollars so they can trade and it was all a lot of it was based on the petrol dollar which by the way Saudi Arabia just quit they didn't renew it I don't know if you heard about that I did hear about that so and all of a sudden CBS news is starting to do news stories about how Saudi Arabia was involved in 911 all of a sudden 24 years later all of a sudden oh you know what turns out and they're like you mean two weeks after they decided to not renew the [ __ ] Petro dollar now CBS News is allowed to talk about that and investigated which when I talked about it got demonetized but anyway um uh so they so that's why because Gaddafi was doing that uh he was going to set up a currency for all of Africa and it was going to be uh based on have a gold standard and so they're like no you're not you're not [ __ ] doing that and they made up a [ __ ] thing like we got to save the people whatever what you know they don't give a [ __ ] about the people in America they got veterans and everybody else living under every goddamn bridge in this country you think if they gave a [ __ ] about those people don't you think they'd start helping the people right outside the front door instead of no we got got to go help people in Libya and we got to help people it's about helping people in Ukraine and it's about helping people in Taiwan and it's about no this is all about an upward transfer of money this is about balkanizing countries and turning and turning it over to Black Rock and Vanguard that's what this is about yeah and we'll be right back that's a good rant that's a solid rant uh Biden is sending 61 billion to Ukraine much of it will pass through the US economy first you mean in weapons manufacturing and things like that by the way there's no oversight isn't it better to just say the US economy why do you have to like look at the bad side of things but but this this is how they this is how they sell it to us like no no we're actually investing in our own country if you want to invest in our own country why wouldn't you build hot [ __ ] bullet trains why wouldn't you do that why wouldn't you bu build affordable housing for people because people can't afford now you know this the new generation can't afford [ __ ] houses why would you do things for people why don't you why would you give people uh healthc care that that doesn't bankrupt them or an education that doesn't bankrupt them we we're ending me I don't think you read that our military aid to Ukraine is revitalizing manufacturing communities across the United States the most inefficient way to stimulate economy is military spending now I've known that for a long time uh it's the the lowest return on your dollar is a crazy spin because yes that is that's a great that's how then that's how they're doing it now that's how they're doing it well you saw Lindsey Graham I don't know if you saw this he said that there's a you know $15 trillion dollar in natural uh um in rare earth minerals in Ukraine and if we don't get it China's going to get it and Russia's going to get it we can't so now 3 years into this war you're telling me it's about why can't we just do regular e e economic [ __ ] and try to out compete people cuz that's all this is these are economic Wars that they turn into well Fred Hampton said that politics is war without violence war is politics with violence yeah and so that's what these wars are there none of them are real they're not what you think they're for uh that's all made up and we keep fall I can't believe people still fall for the Ukraine war well they went into that so quick they got rid of the well rushia gate set it up and I when I was at the Young Turks I would tell those people those knuckleheads at The Young Turks when they were rushia gating I go you know they're going to use this for a war and that's exactly what they oh they knew they were doing that they knew that they were do they were getting people mentally ready for a war with Russia and but this right now it's a proxy war with Russia that's what this is and and of course they did it and of course if you say something they call you a Putin puppet just like you were an Assad to if you if you uh said something the truth about Syria like Tulsi gabard was saying or if you said the truth remember I mean if you said there weren't weapons of mass destruction you were called a traitor the it's the [ __ ] never end it's the same Playbook and people fall for it every time and it's because we are the most propagandized country in the world you think China is you know when people in China watch the news they know it's propaganda and the old Soviet Union people knew that was propaganda the difference between that and now is people in America they think they're watching the news when they turn on Fox CNN MSNBC and isn't it weird it doesn't it never clicks to anybody that when Rachel mattow and Sean Hannity are telling you the same thing about Ukraine doesn't that some will go my Spidey Sense is like oh this is they this is [ __ ] [ __ ] yes it is yes when they're telling you the same thing about covid or vaccines or lock down with does your Spidey senses go up that this has got to be [ __ ] so they all agree again just like the Republicans and Democrats they all agree on the worst of things right they all agree on war they all agree on screwing workers they all agree on keeping us having the most expensive Healthcare in the world they all agree on not doing anything to fix homelessness and not inting investing our own infrastructure but they that so they agree on all the worst things it's like it's like having uh two two uh uh uh divorced parents but they both agree on sending you to military [Laughter] school yeah it's a conundrum for sure but don't you think that more people are aware that it's [ __ ] than ever before I I hope so I I I I think a lot I think Co woke up a lot of people I think it did too and I think shows like yours and these shows that are online now that aren't beholden to a corporation that are independent shows that can actually connect the dots with knowledgeable people that actually understand the history behind everything it's just a different world now you know even with YouTube Joe uh it's amazing how many people told the company line they told the company Ry Ukraine war they towed The Establishment line around covid and vaccines and shamed anybody for it was just amazing I'm like what the [ __ ] is going so there's like there's only maybe a hand couple of places that uh you can get reliable news even in Independent News right yeah the gray Zone had to debunk they debunk everything and uh um uh the gry Zone yeah you this Max Blumenthal and Aaron mate okay yeah and they he um uh they helped debunk Russia gate they helped debunk the Syria gas attacks Aaron mate did extensive work on that I was first but uh you know I got to I'm a dumb guy I have to take credit where I can you know and um but I again how did you debunk that I knew uh because Robert Fisk had done reporting on the ground he was a one of the most decorated War reporters in Europe and uh they it was if it didn't make any sense on on it on its face that Assad who was winning the war at the time would do the one thing Barack Obama said if he crossed that red line and used chemical weapons he would then go do it and he only they only killed like 50 people at a time with a chemical weapon so why the [ __ ] would he do that of course that was a false flag done by and then the opcw uh whistleblow so the opcw which is the organization for the pre prevention of chemical weapons right and so they used to used to be considered you know nonpartisan and non captured and they would go in and they would if there was a chemical weapon used they would go in and they would give du a report well they of course they got captured right by NATO and the billionaire class and so they go in they do their report and they're like oh yeah it was a s he did it but then the whistleblowers came out and said said no that's not what happened they suppressed the engineers report they suppressed this report the these canisters were laid there this didn't this wasn't dropped from a helicop so all this so was it was all [ __ ] right so of course Assad didn't do that right and um and so I I was on to that first and then uh Aaron mate came by back and he did meticulous reporting on it completely he's written at least 10 AR on it which nobody will ever debunk nobody cuz they can't right and he so anyway so um and rushia gate I knew immediately rushia gate was [ __ ] because I brought on Bill Benny who was the number nsa's number one code breaker for decades and decades and he came on and he explained to me that there's they didn't hack into that DNC server that was downloaded locally right and now we know that uh how much [ __ ] they wrote a smear piece about me and they in the Washington Post because I was asking logical questions about what happened with Seth Rich yeah hey like hey where was he from the time he left the bar to the time he got home you're not allowed to ask ethical questions about a guy that Wikileaks said leaked them information that DNC was conspiring to keep Bernie Sanders out of the primary you're not allowed to I remember I was so they had they weree that Jeff Bezos hired a guy uh at the Washington Post to to smear me over that right and they did I don't know if Jeff personally was involved and you think Jeff's busy uh I mean it was his paper but I mean how much time do you think he's spending at his paper uh why do you but why do you think he bought that paper you think he bought that paper because he wants to inform people about what the billionaire class is up to Joe it's super profitable it's not it's not oh it makes billions of dollars a year no it's uh no it does really well it only tells the truth in fact the the the the head of the Washington Post went into the editori went into the news room this is like a month ago and I don't know how it got leaked out that he said Hey Nobody's reading your [ __ ] anymore people are done with the corporate news hopefully right they're and they're fight well that's why you saw that um oh I can't think of her name that idiot for the Washington Post who covers social media she's the tale of the ren yeah The 40-Year-Old teenager yeah and uh she did a Tik Tok about how I don't know PE people you don't know what the people don't understand what the country is going to look like without there these corporate journalists because they just know what I'm going to up and animated Bluebird is on my and we're all going to break out into song okay yeah cuz corporate news is [ __ ] nothing but [ __ ] propaganda we've known this forever right and if you people keep falling for it I I I think people don't think that Independent News can replace it but I 100% think it can and I think there it has a more of a likelihood of doing that because if you can get independent journalists that now they can develop substacks and podcasts and they can go and do things on their own and they get funded they they don't need anyone else anymore so then they can tell the truth right so they're not beholden to some enormous Corporation if a podcast had a building like CNN's building in Atlanta I'd start getting nervous I'd be like hey how much overhead is this yeah how are you guys paying the bills you got so many people working here and your show sucks you have nobody watching and there's so many people this is a [ __ ] disaster like what are you guys doing they just closed there ATA building did they yeah yeah of course they did how are they have another building open how do they have any buildings open imagine a show that gets a podcast that gets that few views but as who knows how many hundreds of employees giant buildings they're on an airport you get zero views nobody gives a [ __ ] I mean it's a crazy business model and you look and and Don Lemon started his own YouTube channel and it's wonderful nobody's watching it's wonderful I got inv Joe Scaro talking so I got invited on that show and I turned it down a few times and and my assistant is like hey look they really want you to do the show and so I was talking to my friend Jackson Hinkle and I said yeah Don Lemon keeps inviting me on the show he goes you got to go and I'm like it would just be me trying to insult him you know it would just be me saying how shitty he is and how he's the you know because I had just gotten done doing a rant about Chris Chromo talking about ior mechon but still still lying about it um and uh and he goes yeah that would be fun to watch you do that and I go okay I'll do it so I told my assistant I go tell them I'll do the show so we set it up I'm and I go just me I go I'm not going on with anyone else I'm not having a debate with another [ __ ] and Don Lemon I go I'll just go on with Don Lemon and they agreed to it and so the morning we were supposed to do the show and our show just me uh they canceled really yes interesting yeah why and I I maybe because some cuz Don lemon's like oh who am I interviewing today and then he Googled me he's like no we're not no we're not and that was right when I did a video you know calling out Chris cromo for being a a lying piece of [ __ ] um that went uh went kind of viral and so all right so Chris cromo probably called up they probably talked they're probably homies he probably saw that video yeah probably he probably went to you know put put in Jimmy door on Twitter and that comes up well he should be if if he wants to become successful being an independent person he's going to have to engage in conversations with people he disagrees with he still he still calls uh the truth about Co conspiracy theories yeah he's a fool he's a genuine he's one of he's one of those guys Ivor me's horse paced uh he's the the the lab theory is racist against Chinese people uh that well not only he had a whole episode with sanj Gupta after sanj Gupta came on here admitted that they were lying about ior and then they tried to pretend that they weren't but it is horse medicine it was used for human beings for 12 [ __ ] years before they ever used they ever used it for veteran medicine Don Lemon you [ __ ] [ __ ] it's just so the the the the the idea that these Talking Heads who they had on CNN should be some sort of a moral compass and and an ethical compass for the rest of us is so [ __ ] stupid and so insulting especially when you see these people on their own so when you see these people on your own their own like when you see Dave Smith debating Chris quo and just [ __ ] nuking him and then you see Don Lemon doing his show and you go okay this is who you guys are for real for real this is the real for real when you see um [ __ ] Brian stelter doing that WF thing hiking up his skirt for those lizard people the whole thing is like this is who you really were this is this is you guys and you surviving on your own in this independent platform good luck because this platform is transparent they're going to see you for who you are no producers no [ __ ] scripts you're going to read off of that [ __ ] won't even work in this realm it doesn't work so so that's why so I have this dream to produce a show that would compete with with Bill Mah uh cuz I I don't know if you've ever seen I do live shows right with a panel and and a live audience right so it's kind of like Bill Mah but it's funny and it's accurate you know so it's the and so that's why I'm like and so I've been pitching it to rumble you know what Rumble is right sure and so thank God for rumble because I don't have to ever worry about right being censored rumble's great they've been out in front on the free like we're not going to sense St whatever the [ __ ] you want that's that's up to you it's up to you and your audience and I'm like oh my God and so I TR around the country and nobody's [ __ ] heard a rumble I mean I mean except more people have now than ever before people are starting and so I tried to talk them in them like hey why don't you finance a show in a Sound Stage for me and we could compete with Bill Mah and instead of real time we'll call it Rumble time and put a we'll put a billboard up in Time Square and right across the street from where Bill does his [ __ ] show and we'll and this is you know it's be like a good idea and for and they were on board and uh but I I guess it was too much money I don't know I don't know how much money they have it wasn't that much it's I got it down to like 990,000 an episode for like a real thing that would look exactly as good as Bill Mah which you know that cost a couple million dollars an episode right did you do it in front of an audience yes of course I I've got show like your standup shows yeah so I so I so I do those I I travel with the that show I take do a video show hooked up to my computer and it's kind of it's kind of a mixture of The Daily Show and Bill marah show I have a panel I do and we have the comedy and it's it's I've seen it's very funny oh okay yeah yeah yeah that one thing about the Rachel mat lying 35 yeah I love that man yeah so I do that and I tour I'm going to uh the next time I'm doing it is uh in in Chicago in August right before the convention I got press credentials oh my God I can't I shouldn't say anything but yeah we probably shouldn't told anybody I shouldn't have said anything but I got him it's be well you're a real journalist you should get press credentials uh I was there in 2016 of course they didn't have any conventions in 2020 because of Co right so but 2016 I went to the rep and the Democrat and that's where I met Alex Jones yeah that's hilarious that video is hilarious um it's hilarious in retrospect um it was I guess at the time too but um yeah it's nice that we've made up and um yeah the Alex Jones thing is strange it's amazing how how right he is about [ __ ] how he he's way more ACC he's way more accurate than corporate news that's for sure but he got that one thing wrong one thing one thing well he's gotten other things wrong but that one thing was a big one and changed maybe they did I mean it could have been that they did I mean that I do think that that is something that does happen one of the things when something happens is people and it I don't know if it's human beings or if it's groups or if it's foreign groups they will concoct a fake narrative and try to get people to share it like they'll try to fool people into sharing a fake version of some real thing that happened and I think they do that to undermine people that are conspiracy theorists that are occasionally correct so if you can get a conspiracy theorist who's occasionally correct and get them a bunch of bad information foolish information and convince them on a website polls get a bunch of people involved that also believe it you know I think that's where Flat Earth got started and you get all these people like sharing things and believing things and then if this person if you they take the bait and they'll go this is what we're hearing we're hearing this is a false flag and then next thing you know like we got him we got him and if you're a guy like Alex Jones who at the time was legitimately experiencing what you would call like a a psychotic break he was breaking you know the guy was drinking like crazy and you know when you're uncovering real conspiracies all day long every day which is what he does nothing seems crazy everything seems Off the Wall the whole [ __ ] world seems Topsy Turvy nothing makes sense he [ __ ] up but he's right so often if you look at what CNN is [ __ ] up on how come they're not in trouble for the weapons of mass destruction [ __ ] how come that in trouble for Russia gate how how come they not in trouble for so which [ __ ] up do you think is bigger the one that Hillary and Barack Obama did in Libya yeah or or Alex Jones which one do you think is bigger and worse yeah one of them seems bigger but it's also it's like the news the news what when they were lying about certain things how much damage did they do well I've always said this that imagine if the news people were skep IAL about the vaccine the news people were skeptical about not being able to use off Lael medications at a doctor's discretion especially ones that have been actually shown to stop viral replication in vitro and there's a history of success in using these things in other countries like er Pradesh in in India there's a bunch of different things that were going on simultaneously and yet they're still being sto would in the real news the real news imagine if the real news is like hold on it seems like there's special interest involved here and there's a financial incentive to push this one thing which is what they have to do in order to get the emergency use authorization act there can't be any valid pharmaceutical drugs that are available currently that we could prescribe that's the only way you can get some new thing to pass through imagine if that was the news and podcasters were like it's safe and effective it's if you get it you won't get sick if you get it you won't share it to anybody else the virus stops with you and then there are no there's none all these this talk about side effects it's not true it's not true I've never seen a single person that had a bad reaction to this new experimental gene therapy imagine if it was the podcasters we would all be in the news we would all be getting sued we would all they would they would use it to shut us down that would be the misinformation that they would feed us to get us to say stupid [ __ ] so that we would endanger people's lives and ruin people's healths and they would shut us down 100% I and I I just how are they not suspect of an industry that has immunity from uh lawsuits if their product harms people like they're the in the history of the humanity that's the only one yeah and you know well why why why did they pass a law that well because they're safe well that doesn't make any sense that's not true that if they were safe you wouldn't need to [ __ ] pass that law that gave them immunity from lawsuits well literally when they were trying to figure out why they needed this and they were saying why don't you make vaccine safe the the literal explanation was it is impossible to make them entirely safe so so what you're saying is they're not entirely safe you're going to injure some people almost all medications of course if you give them to enough people you're going to have side effects and then when you have a new one and then when you understand how they're allowed to do studies and how they're allowed to throw out all the studies that show it does harm or it doesn't work or it's not effective and then you [ __ ] finagle the numbers in a way that you can push it I think we're going to see a real Improvement here like okay run with it go and then the money starts rolling in but of yeah and that's how they captur the news because Bill Clinton let them in 1997 I think they passed a law that let big farmer now most of the funding for news comes from brought to you by fer right and so of course they get to so they're they're not so what I like say is that when you see Boeing advertising on Meet the Press or fiser advertising on CNN they're not funding the news organization's investigation they're funding their non- investigation right they're like this is money so you don't [ __ ] investigate us that's exactly and people who do like my friend Anita Krishna in in Canada a she worked for a um I forget the name of the global news or some big news network in in Canada a and so she started to ask just regular questions that she and she she got fired and she she she uh videotaped her session where they fire her you know like they hey why are you she's like isn't that what we're supposed to be doing we're a news organization aren't we supposed to be asking the questions why there's all these miscarriages that are happening at the hos aren't we supposed to be asking about the explosion of aren't we supposed to be asking these questions isn't that what we do as a news organization and she got fired for that of course yeah and so here's the here's the latest thing but don't you think that this craziness is good for us oh oh oh yeah well I wouldn't have a show if the new if CNN and not just us but us as a population because it's so stupid that we get through it and then more people wake up I hope so I cuz I think it's the only way we were going to really know who's pulling the strings I keep bumping in the you know I go to comedy clubs and you live in LA that's the problem you got to get out Texas is a different world is it really 100% wait till you come oh my goodness oh my goodness you just wait sir really yeah you're in for a time of your life tonight yeah it's wild out here all right that's it's wild world I did a set like I said I did a set at the in Hollywood just the last week and the comedian up to me called me an antivaxer I like you're [ __ ] kidding me it's so dumb it's so dumb you're kidding what does that even mean it's such a dum I took the [ __ ] VX [ __ ] it's so dumb anyway um but there's this new thing Joe so I found out so when I quit smoking pot I couldn't sleep and I thought I was going to die it it was Jesus but for some reason I didn't go back cuz if you don't get sleep it's the worst thing in the world I would sleep for two for 2 hours I would fall asleep and wake up wow and I was like and so um I was told about this thing called HGB HCG no HGB I guess it was it it brought came to America in the 90s I just did a video about it um and it's the ultimate sleep medicine so the problem with the Sleep medicines now is that they don't um they don't give you restorative sleep they just kind of knock you out like an anesthetic right so when you wake up you're still [ __ ] groggy and tired and you don't have that you don't have all the [ __ ] that's sleep does for you right that's the problem but they this wasn't patented and it was easily made you can compound it easily at compounding pharmacies and and wa a bodybuilder used to use it oh yeah yeah and then they said it was a date rape drug drug yeah GB GHB GHB that's it uh they used it as treatment for narly yes so that's the only thing it's approved for now you have to only certain doctors can prescribe it so they what they did this is what they did so not only did it help you with sleep restorative sleep but it helped you with human growth hormone as you got older it helped you with bone it's like a it's almost like a miracle drug kind of like icon right and it's the same thing in fact I just read this it's very potent right if you take too much of it you get bonked out right I guess if you if you if you drink a keg of whiskey it'll do the same thing I would say take the right dose yeah people said that to me they go you know if you take an overdose of it it's bad well then I would not take an overdose I think people drugged women with this before a date rape drug this is this is the propaganda Joe so I just read this article there's this guy called the midwestern doctor he's got this substack he's [ __ ] awesome Pier Corey tweets him out all the time and I don't know if it's a guy or a girl actually it's just a called a Midwestern doctor and he did Deep dive into GHB yeah that stuff and that's how I know all about it right and they did the same thing in fact in one of the subtitles of his article it says uh the the I they did the same thing that ior what they did the iorm and they did to this and so they they all got together and said hey um this is rape drug even though reynol was the rape drug it wasn't G yeah so ruy and guess gu guess which one got banned this one cuz it actually works so you can't get GB you could still get the ruies because the people that made it lobbied the government to not get it made illegal isn't that [ __ ] ironic what is rufinol for what's it knows legitimate use but that I don't know but that's what I read in that Midwestern doctor's article and he explains it all it's it is mind-blowing and so I was trying to get get some of this right you can only get it underground right so these there's certain doctors that make it in certain parts of the country and they give it to soldiers who have PTSD and they do it but if they get caught they're in trouble cuz they made it a schedule one drug wow yeah with cocaine schedule to right so it's even worse so and um I've asked my doctor for like I can't can't do that I can't even tell you where to get it cuz I'll I'll get in TR and so I found a guy who said he could get it for me but I had to put I had to set up a proton mail and I had to get bit coin and I had to do this Jes and by the time all that kind of came together I my sleep had come back so now so now I'm I don't but um they gay guys would use it it says it's illegal rup andol no rol is uh illegal oh is it it's sold sold in some countries as a I'm saying it wrong it's roipnol roipnol yeah um it's sold in some countries as a sleeping pill but it's illegal in the United States because it can cause extreme drowsiness or blackouts often used in date rapes oh okay yeah so it's illegal it's sold under the brand name Ro benzo dipine oh to benzo uh-huh okay and so this uh GHB bodybuilders use it because it helps them recover is the idea and help and again creates growth hormone makes sense and it does it's great for people who are aging and so now now you can't get it andam because they couldn't these [ __ ] someone needs to give that to Biden maybe it help them don't you love that the don't you love the [ __ ] they would say say about like Chris Cuomo said said this when he was talking to Dave Smith he goes well the people who make icton they say it doesn't treat Co you know why because it's off patent you [ __ ] [ __ ] and they can't make money off it so now anybody could make it and it's pennies yeah that's why you don't know that news man yeah how the [ __ ] did Dave Smith I guess Dave Smith didn't know but I mean sitting next to that guy how did he keep his cool I wanted just Dave Smith was such a like he's so levelheaded while that was going on I was like how the [ __ ] did Dave Smith not lose his [ __ ] mind talking to that guy it was glad that it's good that there was a live audience there yeah in the live audience is like [ __ ] [ __ ] dude and when you see him say I didn't do it I didn't say that and then there's a video CP of saying it how does he not know that and then he goes well this is he says that this was the information that we were being given yeah and you're supposed to go out there and debunk the information you're being given by the government and big Pharma you're not just supposed to [ __ ] repeat it if you just did one Google search City wouldn't do that that's all you had to do it does take 5 minutes takes 30 seconds like oh it want a Nobel prize for the human medicine oh my God oh my God it's one of the safest drug profiles ever observed oh ever ever safer than Tylenol how crazy was it when Rolling Stone had that article about people Rolling Stone's the worst waiting in line at the emergency room for gunshot wounds because so many people were overdosing on horse medication and they're all wearing coats in August in Kentucky how are those people not in trouble how are they not in trouble for that because how many people could have gotten ion and gotten over Co and didn't get it well it's and I'm not even saying that it works let's just saying some people think it works some people that are [ __ ] doctors like Pierre Cory it certainly it certainly Works 87 different I mean there's like a bunch of different randomized control trials that shows efficacy and that's another thing I learned is that they uh the people who do the T so the medical journals are also uh corrupted by big Pharma and so what they'll do is with oh we're going to do a we're going to do a study on ior mechon turns out it doesn't work well you look they do the study they set it up to fail right they give it to a person a week after they already got sick you're supposed to give it to them right away they give it to them in way smaller doses than they're supposed to and then they did one where they gave them to way higher doses hlor so they were doing with all so that's what it's a [ __ ] scam so the medical field is just as bought by the same people as your corporate news is so we're all walking around in a big propaganda [ __ ] machine and nobody knows it they think they and they get so righteous and they come you know it's it the crazy thing is doctors buying into it and when you realize that you can't trust them for medical advice you're like wait what when you have a doctor telling you that you should get vaccinated after you just got over being sick and you were only sick for a couple days and you have two two people that you know that had Strokes from the vaccine and you're like wait what who gets vaccinated for a virus they already had and got over nobody that's in the history of ever right yeah nobody my parents but nobody else I knew I know people I know Comedians and that to me oh I know a bunch of comedians that was the heart the Heartbreak I was always so proud to be part of the comedy community or the Brotherhood whatever you know we we we it's a certain kind of thing right we talk in dark terms to each other we say the most inappropriate [ __ ] to each other we but it just all flipped I mean some of my favorite comedians some of my best friends they just [ __ ] went mental and then they attacked me yeah they're just they're not really your friends anywhere they're a bunch of narcissists that all live in this stupid bubble where they're trying to get validation from people by virtue signaling that's all those people were a bunch of cowards and Weirdos and they all turned on everybody and they generally turned on people that are more successful than them that's what they re that's what it's really all about the heart of it it's signaling to your tribe that you are compliant you're a part of the the group think and then attacking the people that are above you that are doing more successfully that are more successful with their career than you that's all it was and all the people that did it are all terrible comedians they're mediocre sad narcissists that wish they got more attention than they got they think they got they didn't get what they deserve they think they need should be getting more they're angry at people that are getting attention they don't understand success of other people and they get he's an antivaxer he's an antivaxer oh that's what's going on that's why he's got millions of views is that's what it is really that what it is isn't it amazing that every day there's a new study there's a new study from South uh Korea that just came out that said the V uh is there's a link between the V the covid V and Alzheimer's right so and still to and nobody will talk about it we're the comedians coming out with the like the same people who always were debunking the co narrative are still the there's no one's jumping on board it's just H I'm telling you brother it's just La yeah you come to Texas that green room's lit we talk about everything yeah no there's no political correctness died here it's dead it's dead I thought it would red hot in Austin mm- no Austin like my friend Brian Simpson has a brilliant joke about it and I'm not going to quote it but it's what he's essentially saying that this it appears that this is a liberal City because you're surrounded by Red Texas but the liberal here is regular liberal it's like what we are what you and I are like regular reasonable people who are kind not like crazy like enfor babies should be trans you know all that [ __ ] that's not here it's like this is a different version because it's so tempered like one of the things they always say about Austin is uh Keep Austin Weird and surrounded so when people say weird weird is okay but keep it weird and surrounded you're surrounded by Ranchers with guns know [ __ ] hardworking people that aren't buying any [ __ ] because they get up at 5:30 in the morning take care of their cows like they're not [ __ ] around here man these are like it's a different kind of people and they're nice and they're informed and that's the thing about this town that's different it's like it's it's they're much more informed you're going to get your liberal loonies here you get your people walking on the street with masks on you get you get a lot of crazy [ __ ] here you get your free Palestine marches and you know you get a lot of nutty people but it's a more tempered environment like people are more reasonable and how about the so there are comedians in Los Angeles who wear a mask into the Green Room mhm and then they take it off with they go on stage right they're all terrible they're all terrible do you do you think the Corona virus is respectful of stage time it is no it is it's the lights those lights they kill the virus so here's the one good thing you know I'm talking about my dreams is so I'll have I've had this happen more than once I'll have a dream where one of my biggest haters uh someone who attacks me on public and social media and stuff like that I'll meet them in my dream and I don't have any any animosity but what I can see in them is where their hatred for me comes from and it comes from their pain and their insecurity and a lot of time it's jealousy like you were saying and I can see it and so I don't have any animosity towards them in my dream and I have compassion for them having compassion for someone who hates you I have it and then when I wake up it doesn't go away it stays with me and it's like this gift from my unconscious my transp personal self God it's a gift yeah and and so it's like that is a gift too really is that where I can I literally have compassion for the people who hate me the most what a [ __ ] gift it's beautiful because it'll eat you up it it it it it still I'm not you know me I'm not 100% it still bothers me sometimes yeah but I've had I've had a dream about that guy yeah that guy just I had a dream about him yeah that guy I'd give him a hug if I saw him thisp he said awful things about me he's just a sad man just a sad pathetic man and that's okay that's your burden in this life you you're going to go to the grave as that guy and everyone's going to know and you you're this irritant that's in the air you're a fart that's in a a locker room you're you're a problem and you this is your choice you've decided to be this very unpleasant very anxiety ridden very mediocre artist who's out there yelling and screaming into the abyss on Twitter well that's your bur this is what you're going to have to go through your life with and I don't envy you and I don't M I'm not even mad at that guy I feel sad yeah I they wear that mask bro it's a [ __ ] Maga hat that's a Maga hat for Democrats it's unbelievable and then you see people I'll still see people today that choose to wear a mask and then they wear it under their nose that's my favorite are you got to be [ __ ] it doesn't work anyway if you you want to be anti-science wear a mask that [ __ ] does not work work especially a surgical mask get the [ __ ] out of here you [ __ ] that's that's it's SOG mask stupid it's so stupid you don't even know what a surgical mask is for it's to keep particulates from people's mouths from dropping into wounds that's what that's for yeah it doesn't stop anything from respiratory like a respiratory virus and going in they go I've had people say oh why why don't you go tell the doctors cuz all the doctors wear masks I go yeah in the in the operating room so [ __ ] doesn't fall out of their mouth into an open wound you know when they come over before you get before you go into the operating room the doctor comes over to talk to you he takes his mask off and he talks to you remember that they don't [ __ ] have it on when they're stupid it's so stupid stupid it's like it's so childish but yet it became official Doctrine just like the six foot distance thing and so oh I want to say so the you know we've seen fouchy lie to Rand Paul twice about funding the gain of function research right yeah up and down the chain people are saying [ __ ] you mean the people you hired uh and so he lied to Congress twice at least about that right and then everything else he just lied about uh but there will be no consequence that's the thing that's unsatisfying it's good to to watch them the the them confront him the congressman that were confronting him uh isn't it interesting though that the same thing happened to him with AIDS right so if people forget there's that movie called The Dallas Buyers Club yes and Matthew MCC won the goddamn Oscar for that movie and the bad guy in that movie Dr [ __ ] fouchy mhm and so you know Matthew mccon he knows that why doesn't he say something I think he wants to keep working that's exactly it exactly it you got to keep your head down you can't go yeah if you go Woody harson people they automatically write HIIT pieces on I love that guy I love that guy too when he did that thing on S right L they started writing HIIT pieces on immediately immediately yeah they know what they're doing they know what they're doing they're little lap dogs but also nobody believes those HIIT pieces the people that read it that hate Woody harelson they already hated him it's like you're not going to get those people back you're going to have a certain amount of people that don't like you no matter what so those hit pieces don't really work anymore they just inform your haters that oh I'm on the right track I knew he was a [ __ ] that's that's all it is it's just it's it it's not real the whole thing's not real and everyone knows it's not real when a guy goes on Satur live and has a funny monologue that's essentially realistic you know and it's about that was that was so perfectly said too amazing it was amazing it was amazing and of course they attacked them but that just all that does really is show you where the demons are like who's attacking him for that who who are the people that have sold their soul who are the people that are willing to go after this guy for saying something that we all know to be true you going to go after him for that remember when they went after Eric Clapton oh my God they went after him so hard and Eric Clapton who was vaccinated who was vaccinated had a horrible reaction to the vaccine he was a racist they found some some black guy who worked with him 20 years ago said he was a racist he's a racist he's a racist everything they went after him antivaxer racist is responsible the death of Millions with his his poor choice of words describing his personal Illness but that's how transparent everything is you know that's I mean you know obviously I experienced it it's it's fascinating to watch it happen when they turn on you it's weird it's weird because for for me the weirdest thing about it was like the play was so stupid because I was obviously okay I was obviously healthy really quickly well you did look green I should have filmed it because I worked out um 6 days later I did 10 Rounds on the heavy B cuz I wanted to find out if I felt good and I felt fine wouldn't you be more interested and how someone got better if you really wanted the world to be a healthier Place he'd be like what did that guy do that's different he's just telling you what he did and he got better and he wasn't vaccinated so what did he do that's different and wouldn't that be what the news wants but no when the news is controlled by giant corporations that is an uncomfortable truth that is a that is a real problem having that narrative out there there's someone out there that can get healthy without taking this thing that we're telling everybody they have to take but if it worked why would you care if I took it if you took it now you can't get it so you just but let me get sick let me be a dummy that just gets sick and recovers which most people did that's the other thing they wanted to pretend that like 10% of the people were dying the hospitals overun no it's like 99.7% of the people survived and the people that didn't survive had a three coties four four morbidities four so and then as soon as Bill Gates cashed in his stock y you saw he starts [ __ ] on the facts well you know we didn't know that the it had a low fatality rate the virus had a low fatality rate and that the the vaccine it wasn't long lasting and it didn't block transmission or contraction and so we got to do better we got this new thing it's a nasal thing he literally does that we got this new thing and this actually works better I look into it he's [ __ ] funding that nasal thing of course he is of course he is I mean that's and now he's buying up all the Farmland he's smart he's a megalomaniac that's the he's also a guy that U people don't realize at one point in time was very hated he was hated in the 90s he was antitrust yeah because he was monopolist and he knew how to crush people who had Innovation and uh and and so they they throw pies in his face yep and then he got smart and he was like oh I'm going to buy the media that's exactly spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying media corporations off and so like when you see um a PBS NewsHour do a thing on vaccines it's being funded by Bill Gates yeah and it's about a vaccine that he's invested in and it's it's all so he's funding the vaccine he's funding the noo that's going to distribute it he's funding the the the funding the media coverage of the thing it's like every which way he's got it and so because he wears a crew neck and he looks like a a nerd people think nerds wouldn't lie yeah that's why people think think Chris Hayes on MSNBC he's a nerd he wouldn't lie Rachel M homosexuals they don't lie they're they're naturally good people especially if she's wearing a business suit she's so serious she's a noons business like she wears those fake Megan Kelly eyelashes and she wears yes and then she wears jeans that are three times too big for her that talk about someone in Conflict oh does she really oh yeah she wears the man jeans that are gigantic and then she wears the Megan Kelly eyelashes interesting the man jeans is an interesting choice yes wonder what that's saying that's some that's someone in deep conflict with themselves m yeah interesting so that's nice but $100,000 a day Smooths that over I guess that's a lot of money you could spend that in all sorts of fun ways U 100 Grand a day thinking you buy a Porsche a day and that was her reward about that was wow One Porsche a day that just have a 911 for every day of the week it's worth lying go around corner sideways we listening to good Tunes Rod Stewart wake up Maggie let's go driving down the Malibu Coast sorry so that's the example that's the so they put Julian Assange in prison right in Bel Marsh and Rachel matow does rush aate lies about Ukraine lies about Libya lies about Syria and they she gets $100,000 a day I'm glad you brought up Julian Assange because what did he have to do to get free so he had to admit that he he committed one felony but didn't he have to delete things oh he did turns out I didn't know yeah it turns out they did delete some some [ __ ] like 20,000 documents or something oh that's only 20,000 it's no big deal but man oh man what was it about man oh man that guy I mean what a hero what a unbelievable absolute hero I thought he was going to die I thought he was going to die in that prison too what do you think happens to him now and it looks like they knew they were going to let him out because when they let him out he had a little bit of weight on him it looked like he wasn't as frail as he once was oh like they think they feeding him good they looked like hey start S send him three meals a day get him all the steak and everything so when we let him go he doesn't look horrible oh was he eating poorly before that well he was I mean you I I saw pictures of him he looked horrible yeah well he's not getting any vitamin D right he's indoors all day long for 10 years like how long was he in jail for or locked up so he was in that prison for 6 years but he was in that Embassy for I think eight years before that or something like that God damn yeah he was in prison for six years I'm pretty sure six years so Jamie you'll find out didn't he go in was it 2019 says s and a half years total but I don't uh seven and a half seven and a half years of self post confinement and then 5 years of enforced detention okay so 5 years in Belmar 7 and 1/2 years in that in that Ecuadorian Embassy Jesus Christ where that guy how did he not go crazy I don't know how he didn't go crazy and then they made him pay for his flight home half a million dollars half a million flew private though probably had champagne strawberries don't you why wouldn't someone like Mark Mark Cuban who who brags about he brags about he loves his jet collection like why would he just send a jet over there to take care of him he's busy arguing people on Twitter oh see he's another [ __ ] Maniac yeah he likes arguing on Twitter yeah it's interesting to watch and he's wrong about almost everything he's wrong about quite a bit RAV aora is uh this young kid who's a journalist who's really good and he's uh gone back and forth with them to the point Mark Cuban has to step out of the chat gets he just gets clowned it's just weird that a person that that busy would choose to engage with people in like the the one of the poorest ways to communicate like to go back and forth in argument with people on Twitter if you want to post things and you know you have something that you feel like it's on your mind like go post that but when you start arguing with people on Twitter like I go how much time do you have no kidding how do you have the time don't you own 85 million companies that you have to run it's a it's like a sign of mental illness to be arguing with people all day on Twitter in my opinion I think when I see people arguing with people on Twitter I'm like oh that's a person that's racked with anxiety that's like very truly unhealthy person there's no way you can't you're going back and forth with people you you feel it you're a human being if you're in conflict and you're trying to get one up on the person every [ __ ] tweet and you're checking your Twitter every five minutes to see who's responded and how it's doing did you get ratioed oh my God I got ratioed [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and then your wife's upset and your kids Daddy can we play hold on hold on you're in the middle of tweeting it's [ __ ] it's manic stuff it's not good for you it's bad for you it's a bad way to communicate the best way to communicate is civy in front of a person that's the best way even if you're yelling screaming at a person right in front of you that feels bad too you should be able to as a grown adult have a civil conversation with people where you could disagree with even really disagree with something but just keep like a professional polite tone but but there's this um you know what's interesting as I just interviewed this woman called Blair white I don't know if you yeah I had Blair on so I told her I said you know when right-wing trans person yeah who what are the odds right so I've I've had I've had I have trans fans come to the show right Kurt [ __ ] I'm in the green room but dare depending depending how they look and um but uh and they have guns like I've had a couple of trans fans come to there and they're like like hey you want to see my gun and I was like kidding that's hilarious so but anyway um uh when I when I was talking to her I was like you know I feel like you're a woman like I get the energy of a female from you and whereas Dylan malaney is seems like a gay guy doing an unbelievable caricature of a woman right and agreed and she she agreed and she said yeah he has gay boy energy yeah and so she went she went to these LGBT Q the The Pride parades right and she would ask people how many genders do you think there are and when do you think kids should be allowed to have a gender affirming care and have uh hormones and stuff so she's asking these questions right which we're all talking about right and she's doing it in a polite way and the [ __ ] way people turn they they had security following her she basically got kicked out of the LG The Pride Fest and and people are like [ __ ] you like they found out that uh she says to one guy uh you know what do you think about Donald Trump uh he was the he was the first president in the United States to go into the White House supporting gay marriage be and like I never looked I thought of it like that and they're like oh you're a trump supporter [ __ ] you I'm like I always thought that the the the Gay Pride movement was about uh tolerance and diversity and let me be my thing and you can do your thing now it's like no you're only allowed to have one opinion you're only allowed to have one political view and if you step out it's like it's [ __ ] you yeah exactly isn't it that's the opposite of what I thought the gay movement was all about it's the opposite of what the progressive movement's supposed to be all about the Progressive Movement is all supposed to be about intelligent well-educated compassionate people that have a better perspective of how things are and what causes people to live in unfortunate circumstances and the inefficiencies of so many government organizations and the importance of the workingclass community that's what it's supposed to be about it's supposed to be about like yeah being kind and helping people and supporting workers and rights and all those things that that's what it originally was but the problem is with any ideology if you have to have a rigid adherence to whatever the ideology States whatever the the doctrine is that can shift to the point where it's no longer even a progressive value and you call yourself a progressive yet you support all these ideas like you support the the war in Ukraine you support all these different things [ __ ] insane censorship yeah the FBI the Hallmark of authoritarian dictators is censorship and they got people who consider themselves Progressive to be for so like I I say I I'm I've never changed I'm for bodily autonomy my body my choice which you don't hear people say anymore what they'll say is I'm for I'm Pro abortion no one no you say I'm a woman's right to choose yeah that's what they say that's what people like to say the most okay I've heard people start saying they're pro-abortion no one's Pro abortion well but anyway so I I've stayed my body my choice bodily autonomy I'm anti-war I'm pro-worker and I'm anti-censorship for free speech those are all considered right-wing positions now it's crazy it's crazy but it just shows you that what we're talking about it's just the ideology it just it's just a cult it when there's two Cults in this country there's the right-wing cult and the leftwing cult and there's a bunch of people that are centrists there's a bunch of people that have like a little bit of this and a little bit of that and they're kind of in the middle and they're kind of like a left leaning conservative or right leaning Progressive and they're confused and they don't know what to think and I think the majority of people are kind of really if you isolated them and get them out of their tribal thinking the way they look at the world and if they could if it could be explained to them in a a kind way they most people are in the center most people I think I generally think most people are but the people on the far left are so [ __ ] crazy and the people that are on the far right are so [ __ ] crazy that if you're on the left you see the people on the far right well I'm not that [ __ ] person so I must be on the left and then if you're on the right and you go yeah but I'm kind of like pretty open-minded when it comes to a lot of social issues but then you see antifa you go well what the [ __ ] I'm not with those people I must be rightwing and then you have this chaos that we have currently that the whole left I I just I call I don't call them you know go oh the farle I just call them Democrats right because they became they're not that's not left if you're for war it's not left if you're for censorship it's not left if you're for mandating experimental Medical Treatments right that's not that's there's nothing left about that right you just vote Democrat and so and these are two [ __ ] constructs being left right I don't think it it m matters that much I've got way more in in common with uh people who are considered right-wing than I do with Joe [ __ ] Biden right do you know what I and we're and the thing is that people don't realize if when they say organ I've talk I told you this before when people say we have to organize along class lines that means organizing with trumpers the workers that's what they Christian Smalls did on uh Staten Island when he organized the First Union uh in Amazon right he he didn't go down there and go hey who here is for lgbtq hey who here is a gun nut you're out who's not uh who's for freedom of speech you're out who he just want who's here to get together we have an economic interest to oppose the man you're with me that's how you [ __ ] organize you come around and you don't you don't have all these things that exclude it's all about excluding people and by the way I found out that all that all this trans stuff all this it's all come from the top down it doesn't come from the bottom up I I figured this out when I saw that Larry Fink the head of black rot talk about enforcing ESG and Dei and so that's because those companies are the ones who are raping the planet and screwing everybody but then they stick a gay pride flag on what they're doing so they can wrap themselves in a patina of virtue and that's all that is and that's coming and it's also great because it keeps us divided so if we're fighting over bathrooms and people uh competing in sports and swimming and all that then we're not our eyes off the ball right our eyes off the 200 or 600 billion dollars they're sending to the military industrial complex and an up for transfer of wealth we're not talking about the cares act the larg we're not talking about things that actually matter that people are still living under bridges people don't have Healthcare that doesn't bankrupt them people can't go bankrupt just trying to go to college people don't have a decent 80% workers living paycheck to paycheck half the country can't afford a $500 emergency all that [ __ ] we're not talking about any of that stuff if we're talking about all that other stuff exactly exactly and that's part of the Playbook The Playbook is keep the people distracted and divided that's always been the Playbook and then while we're in the middle of these International conflicts that are baffling to everybody involved and you're wondering how they have all this money to do that but they don't have any money to address all the problems that we have how about the people in Maui imagine being a person home they give you $700 and then you still can't rebuild it's a year later nothing's been built and at the blink of an eye they give a hundred billion do to zalinsky and and well even worse they accidentally sent Ukraine 6 billion they sent an accidental six billion so then we looked up like how much would it cost to rebuild every house that got destroyed in the fire five billion so they could have done that so why wouldn't they do that why wouldn't they do that why wouldn't they do that I don't understand those people are devastated and then there's all this talk about like taking over that land and well you go to Maui I was in Maui and you see people have uh put graffiti on the side of building saying this is a land grab yeah you see that a lot it is a land grab it's a pretty transparent land grab right it's happening in front of our eyes and no one's doing anything about it because it's 5 hours in a jet across the ocean and we're watching this [ __ ] take place where these people and first of all just horrible mismanagement of water rights horrible mismanagement of power lines the fact that they have horrible winds crazy winds there and they've had these [ __ ] power lines that are above ground when I lived in California my [ __ ] lines were underground they figured it out there how come they didn't figure it out in Hawaii you know how much money could have been saved they just put the power lines underground it was so unfortunate that their alarm system malfunction yeah how about that and that the water got turned off so the firefighters they wouldn't let them turn the water on people the the water's very valuable commodity there the whole thing is [ __ ] insane and that the cops are turning people back into the fire it's just it's just these the whole thing is insane these are these are all just unfortunate this unfortunate things how about that mayor who goes on TV like what two weeks after the fires talks about how they're going to like try to figure out how to turn into a monument oh I didn't know I didn't see that you see that speech was it the mayor or the governor I forget which which guy it was but he was talking about how they're talking about erecting a monument and like turning into a park or something like the it's super valuable land where these people are yeah that's the problem that everybody people have these homes on super valuable piece of land and if should happen some WS oops whoopsies whoopsies if that whoopsies happens and then they can figure out a way to take it you know have you ever seen a fire that melted the wheels off cars and it does I mean fires do do that yeah yeah okay yeah extreme heat is [ __ ] insane what it does to cars and also cars are filled with oil oil and gasoline the the kind of heat that you get off of a burning vehicle is extraordinary you know when you're like fires are one thing like a wood fire but a fire of a car that's filled with 30 gallons of gas and has rubber tires like that heat is [ __ ] extraordinary extraordinary I don't believe you I mean fire can do wild things man it it really can but the the real problem is how they handled everything it's so poorly done by the way they've had wildfires there commonly because of the fact that they have like see there yeah thise this is Tennessee yeah liquid aluminum so the the the wheels melt so that's all liquid aluminum that's the wheels melting yeah I believe you yeah fire from gasoline and everything in a car is made out of plastic think about if you have vinyl seats and plastic grommets and all these different plastic pieces that are on your side you know your your a columns and all this that's plastic the [ __ ] steering wheel's plastic the dashboard's plastic all that [ __ ] goes up and bro you better get the [ __ ] out of the way and 30 gallons of gasoline like that that's that's heat man that melts everything melts melts Mufflers melts everything uh anything aluminum is [ __ ] so do you so there's no way to vote our way out of these problems it doesn't seem like in America that we're at this end what do you think we can do what what do you think is the real solution to try get us on the right path what is the thing that can be done I I think there has to be a you know like you say there's an Awakening of people realizing that they're being screwed over by a a billionaire class that's it's International right like so the Border being open so that's not only happening in America that's also happening in Europe right you you've seen that and you see what's happening to London France what they're doing in Scotland places like that and and uh Poland said no right they closed their border but um uh I think this is some kind of bigger plan to uh and so I think what if people wake up to that which I think they are starting to uh it's going to look it it look something like the trucker protest in Canada a um you always say a after Canada every time that tick um I I I think it's going to look like something like something like that that we have to have a way to to we got to make you know like January 6 which was you know a freaking instigated by the FBI we know that I love did you see the guy who was the the congressman he was interviewing the head Christopher Ray the head of the FBI and he said did you have any FBI assets inside the capital before the breach dressed up like Maga people and he says I can't answer that he and the congressman goes the answer should be no it should be no so what so again and and so that was an attempt to criminalize Trump and criminalize his political movement the same grand jury the same RICO statute that they used to indict Donald Trump in Atlanta they used to also same RICO statute same grand jury to indict the stop cop City protesters and you know when I when I made that case to Cornell West I go do you see the game that's being played now because they they're not only criminalizing their political opponents in the United States they're doing that all around the world they did that in Pakistan so Imran Khan the guy who stood up and said people of Pakistan do not want to go along with NATO's Wars anymore he immediately threw him in jail now he's a criminal they did the same the same thing they did in Brazil they didn't want L to be president so they threw him in in jail right and so they thought the center right guy was going to win but then the farri guy bolsonaro won the trump of Brazil they're like oh [ __ ] what do we do so they had to let Lula back out of prison because he's the only one who could beat him and then once they beat him they then made it illegal for bonaro to ever run for president again and it's the same [ __ ] they're doing how do they make it illegal for bolsonaro to not run for president they they it's like they're trying to do to Trump right now G the four different you 92 felony so they [ __ ] charges against them I don't know the ins and outs I know they did I know they did that um so so that's what so I think people need to wake up to that and wake up to uh if anybody you know if anybody catches on fire and that is a problem for the establishment they criminal look what they did the goddamn Russell Brand for [ __ ] sake yeah uh so immediately if you get a voice and you become a problem for the establishment that's the new game they just criminalize you now and everybody goes along with it everybody can you believe how people go along with the they say that what they are con currently doing to Donald Trump they say he's gonna do that to us yeah you're already [ __ ] doing it we've already this whole idea that somehow he's doesn't isn't that kind of mind-blowing how do people not well Andrew CUO was on the Bill Maher show and he admitted that they should have never brought that case and that if if he was the Attorney General he would have never did it and the only reason that case was ever brought was because it was Donald Trump was the center of it this is how dumb they are they went after that guy Andrew Cuomo which if you were going to be strategic about who is your tough guy Democrat that could be president why would they it's that guy yeah and they gave him an Emmy for his [ __ ] coverage of Co yeah hilarious and they took it away but listen you know he's not a virologist he's acting on a bunch of different experts that are telling him what to do including letting people that have covid back in the nursing homes which turns out to be devastating and then also the use of V ventilators which they thought was important they needed we thought we needed turns out to kill people killed some bizarre number like 80% of the people they put on ventilators want up dying yeah so and and then they would give you drugs that slowed down your breathing but my point is if that doesn't happen that guy's your guy against Trump yeah that guy's your guy I mean that's a big tough guy who speaks well he's charismatic his big Italian guy who's going to lay it I mean great speaker you heard him on Bill Mah I'm like boy if it wasn't for this one scand of him liking a hug ladies oh we just you know I'm Italian we like I like the you know we we play little grab ass you know was a big deal Bo you know I mean Joe Biden has been is that your phone that keeps dinging Joe Biden has been sniffing kids and hugging people forever Jesus Christ you know I mean he's maybe it's me no it's me is it okay I mean he's a [ __ ] weird guy and they just decided for whatever reason that they were going to take quo out and I never understood that that strategic move and it must have been some sort of an inside power grab play but then they replace him with that hu lady who's out of her [ __ ] mind God has brought us this vaccine this vaccine's brought by God like what are you even [ __ ] talking about and then she fired 100,000 healthcare workers how about when she said that black people don't know what a computer is don't know what a computer is how crazy is that yeah how crazy is that to even say imagine anyone else so that's that's how you know how corrupt the media is cuz they didn't make a big deal out of that no everybody was like what the [ __ ] did you just did you see the memes or the videos that uh kids made no the oh my God so many funny videos of black kids moving around a computer like confused like a caveman like look they see the computer open it up well I I mean your your phone is a computer dude everyone knows what a [ __ ] computer is it's 2024 that's like Joe Biden in the primary in 2020 play the record player they they need to hear words turn on the don't the idea that poor black people don't have a laptop what the [ __ ] are you talking about everyone's online you [ __ ] everyone literally the whole countries online did you see the the mayor of New York uh he said that uh so they're trying to get these immigrants jobs and he's like well a lot of them are real good swimmers we could you didn't see that yeah I did see that oh yeah insane it's like when you want beard when you want to call them wetbacks but you want to be politically correct J that's what that was it's so crazy the whole thing is so C it's so crazy to watch all the gaslighting and chaos and well it's it's also amazing to see that the Democratic party is now the establishment party and it used to be the other way the the Democratic party used to be the party that represented workers and was against the the the the billionaire class but then Bill Clinton and and Al Gore no friend of The Working Man they they saw Reagan are like hey if you can't beat him join him and so they decided like they they said Wall Street we got it give us the money military give it they they started a thing called the Democratic Leadership Council the DLC do you know who was on the board of the DLC Koch brothers they were on the [ __ ] board well they want the world to be a better place too and so that and so they just want to help people that's what it's about they want to bring democracy that's what I've been saying I'm glad you came around thank you that's why I brought you here I brought you here to educate you I'm an educator uh breaking President Biden says at a conference called he's staying in yes I'm running I am the leader of the democratic party no one is pushing out I've been knocked down before and counted out my whole life when you get knocked down you get back up y I think uh I got a I bet my phone was lighting up I like his Moxy I like it I've been told by I I I have a billionaire friend who's like a donor they go hey they had a big donor meeting in Denver like 40 of the top Democratic donors and they said who here wants to get rid of Joe Biden and every hand went up so that's I think Joe Biden is a secret Trump fan that's what I think and I think she knows the way to get Trump back in the White House and straighten this country out is to keep her husband Joe Biden running there's no way she thinks he's okay so something's going on why what what like conspirator pretend to be Kurt Meka for a moment and what do you think like if you had to say why would she want him in you would say well because she thinks maybe he can win even though he's demented and maybe she can stay in power but also maybe he doesn't get prosecuted so this is my question about the recent Supreme Court ruling about the presidential immunity if I was in the Democratic party and I looked at what's going on with Donald Trump and I looked at the very real possibility that Donald Trump might get back into the White House I would say listen all this barisma stuff all this this this is Big Time [ __ ] there's a lot of evidence not a little bit of evidence like the Trump thing not 34 charges of felonies which is just a demeanor that's just 34 different checks he wrote for a porn star which is what a cheap bastard he paid her over 34 different times like payments I'll give you installments I'll give her installments a little bit here a little bit there she doesn't get it all in one lump well did you ever see the video how Bill Clinton paid off Paula Jones back when he was running for president when she had a big she had the big check remember she had the big check she w a game show oh really yeah $850,000 he paid her off right and back then and they admitted it they go hey okay now this is over we paid her off yep how well the thing was like writing it down on a ledger as campaign that's the but that in normal cases as Andrew Cuomo said on Bill Mar show that's just you get a fine I'm telling you [ __ ] up with that Cuomo guy that guy could have been the president and he'd probably be a good president he was a good mayor I mean he's a good Governor like wasn't he wouldn't he's better than holel right I mean I don't know he like everybody loved him at the beginning of Co loved him you know Chelsea Handler was saying she's cuomosexual remember homosexual everybody loved him everybody loved him because he was the stern like uh straightforward practical he was the anti yeah he was a leader he seemed like a leader big handsome guy he speaks very well he also seems like a mob boss you know it's like oh yeah he'll took care of it Mr quomo Mr Cuomo's got it all under control are they [ __ ] up like that you have so few charismatic people that you that are experienced in politics that could have actually gone against Trump that was the main guy in my opinion yeah and I was hoping for it because the guy who does the voices on my show Mike McCrae he does an Andrew K doesn't do good one he does a very funny one yeah I like when you have people call in that aren't the people and a lot of people like what people think it's him yeah who do you have call in like what different people well the first time I had Bill O'Reilly call in people at kpfk were like and they go Bill R just called someone a [ __ ] and I'm like no that's so was that he did an amazing U Mitt Romney he was hoping for Mitt Romney to get elected remember when Howard Stern had that guy that would call in as Letterman it was dead on oh and I never listen Howard St oh my God Howard Stern used to have this de Letterman guy would call him dead on really dead on just saying wild [ __ ] and he would say it was David leburn oh David lean's on the phone that's what I do I just pretend I just pretend oh he um also does uh Jeff Bridges who does Jeff Bridges that's a weird one hey I can't do it I can't do it like far out man oh he does Jeff Bridges as Labowski yeah yeah yeah it's one of the greatest movies of all time all time all time and um he does him who else is the dude that the nor nobody else does um oh he does a great Kevin uh spy oh wow oh it's [ __ ] everything he says is like that that's right tell me about your lesbian a niece anyway it's uh so he he does a yeah he's brilliant um uh so I was he was he was pulling he was hoping for Mitt Romney because nobody else done Mitt Romney did you see the contrast between the debate in 2012 with Barack Obama and Mitt Romney and there somebody put side by side VI no no no no no no just the the way they spoke with each other there's a video that shows the contrast between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama speaking so cordially and professionally and graciously to each other in 2012 and then 2024 with uh Trump and Biden going at each other you're a sucker you're a loser you know and then he's like he can't play golf he's got no golf game I'm six handicap he goes I have a six six handicap but that's how Wild that dude is and then he changes immediately goes it was an eight like you just switched it he's a [ __ ] artist and the worst but but I love what when when Trump says to you let's not be children here like holy [ __ ] yeah yeah it's hilarious yeah I'll I'll play golf with you but you got to carry your own bags like do you think you can carry your own bags you can't walk down a [ __ ] flight of stairs this is crazy you can't even carry the OWN load in your pants it's just what a wild time man do you think he [ __ ] himself people were saying he [ __ ] himself when he was with mcon remember he bent over perhaps maybe he was preventing himself I've [ __ ] myself before things happen things go wrong things go wrong that's what I say about Mitch McConnell people go you see him have a stroke I go no he [ __ ] his pants look at his face I I know that face I've made that face the Mitch McConnell one I think he's I think he Windows 95 yeah I think he locked up yeah he clicked someone need to control alt delete Yeah that poor guy all those people they like you shouldn't you know we have the oldest [ __ ] people why well because the young people are all you know there's all bunch of ex-girlfriends and ex-husbands out there that are talking [ __ ] about terrified to R and if have real leadership qualities they probably have a buch of disgruntled former employees and a bunch of people they can call they can make up stories they can concoct narratives if you're not chosen to be in that position you want to Buck the system that's what we're seeing with Trump they come for you they come for you in very very look how they came for RFK Jr look at out and they're still doing it they just bring brought up a thing about a nanny from in the late 90s did you see that like yesterday no yeah but here's the thing about RFK junr they don't think he can win looking up at Biden farting or [ __ ] himself and found this story I never heard what does it say Joe Biden or the new Mr Trump Camila hasn't stopped talking about hearing the president break wind during the chat at uh cop 26 climate summmer in Glasgow so Biden fart himself it was a long and impossible to ignore to ignore Camila hasn't stopped talking about it that Biden just farts farted at a NOA meeting yeah he produced a little natural gas of his own at the cop2 Sumit audible enough to make the Duchess of Cornwall blush but is this the Daily Mail yeah they can just kind of say things can't they oh okay over there they can just kind of say things you know that's why from Politico and then oh they say it too they were reporting their repor oh my goodness maybe it is true let's go with it old people fart it happens yeah that guy's not in control of anything you think he's in control of his farts so do you think someone messed up and gave Joe Biden the real vaccine I don't think that's what happened I think he's dying I mean he had two brain surgeries he had a brain surgery where they literally cut the top of your head off he had aneurysms like he had like but but the but like look I told you the study from South Korea like it help the Alzheimer's thing yeah it Spurs it on I mean I don't think any of that stuff's going to help I mean but I think he was already at a deteriorating state was definely period so I saw a guy this guy Dr John Campbell sure great he think yeah he says um although he he pretends I won't I don't exist won't respond to me what do you mean he won't come on my show he won't talk to me he won't wonder why I don't um he goes on everybody else's show but including Russell BR I'm like but um uh he he just the other day I saw a video I I tweeted it out that he says he thinks he has Louis body dis disorder which is what I think Robin Williams yes he did yeah and so and he talks about all the different things that and people will mistake it for Alzheimer's and they'll mistake it for Parkinson's and but it's really this Louis body disorder thing so he might be right he's been right for the through the entire pandemic very reasonable and very right when he's talking about once he realized yeah that it was a lie yeah and then he's like he got duped he he it's like all these people like even like Pier Cory's like I didn't realize how corrupt a medical in field is and how they control the medical journals and they can just make a study that will just prove a drug is good and they'll just do it wrong say it's bad yeah and so yeah he was so he found this out through Co too that like wow the medical journals are all corrupt and what were you saying that he was so he thinks that Biden has Lou body dementia yeah that's it wow yeah I mean it's just shocking that he can say that I'm not going anywhere you get knocked down you get back up like there's no ability no one knocked you down but no one has the abil that's what's crazy no one has the ability in the Democratic party to pull him aside and say it's over like who who would be that person this is the right yeah why Obama was the one who got everybody to drop out in the primary in 2020 right except for Elizabeth Warren so they could split the vote of Bernie right right right so I think it's Obama so why wouldn't Obama have that power over him now you think once he's president he's like I'm president godamn it I think he's getting replaced I think he's get I think he's getting replaced I don't care what he says would you think there's a possibility they would someone I think possibly if they needed to you could
