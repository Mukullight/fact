## Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)

**Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)** is a trading algorithm primarily used to minimize the impact of large trades on the market. TWAP aims to execute an order by evenly distributing trades across a predetermined time period, achieving an average price close to the time-weighted market price. This strategy is commonly used when liquidity is a concern, or when traders want to reduce the visibility of large orders to avoid driving prices up or down.

### Key Points

- **Objective**: TWAP divides an order into smaller, evenly spaced trades across the desired timeframe, reducing market impact and avoiding price spikes.
- **Calculation**: The TWAP price is calculated by taking the average of prices over a set interval. For example:

  \[
  \text{TWAP} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T} P_t}{T}
  \]

  where \(P_t\) is the price at each time interval \(t\), and \(T\) is the total number of intervals.
  
- **Use Cases**: 
  - For illiquid stocks or large block orders that could distort the market price.
  - Ideal when the market is relatively stable, as it doesnâ€™t react to sudden price movements.

    Generates a trade schedule based on the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) strategy.

    Parameters:
    data (DataFrame): The input data containing timestamps, max_bid_price, volume, closing prices, and slippage.
    initial_inventory (int): The total number of shares to be sold over the preferred timeframe.
    preferred_timeframe (int): The total number of time steps (default is 390, representing a full trading day).

    Returns:
    DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the TWAP trades with timestamps, effective price, shares sold, and remaining inventory.
